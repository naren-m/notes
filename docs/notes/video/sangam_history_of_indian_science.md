## Transcript
Namaste I'm Raj vam and in this series of talks I'd like to present to you Indian knowledge systems and specifically the historicity of Indian knowledge systems so in this series of talks I've designed it so that first I'll talk to you about the problems in the historiography of India and from there what impact that narrative has on our knowledge systems and having said that I will give a brief idea of the kind of work I have been doing on Indian knowledge on on on Antiquity of the Indian civilization and from there I'll talk to you about astronomy Indian astronomy I'll talk to you about Indian mathematics I'll talk to you about Indian medicine and after that we'll go to the historicity the historical tradition of the Indian knowledge systems so these series of Le leur es hopefully will give a rounded idea about the Indian civilization itself so before I start om Shri gurub namah by pronouns to our gurus and many teachers who have taught us over the ages so to set the context right we'll start with talking about the unsatisfactory historiography of India so we have many problems in The Narrative of Indian history today we have what I call an enforced Narrative of history and in contrast to that we got something that looks like an evidence-based history so we are told enforced by people like ncrt enforced by the government of India enforced in media movies and things of that nature they tell us that we are a recent civilization but our evidence shows that bhattia people are an ancient civilization they tell us that there was an Arian Invasion or migration to indiaan 1500 BCE but we can show that we are indigenous people for the longest time we are are not Arians dravidians tribals we are an indigenous people they tell us that knowledge systems developed in India with input from Babylon Greece and all these old civilizations but we can show that Indian knowledge systems developed independently and in fact impacted these other civilizations too they tell us this enforced narrative that we have aggressive uncivilized inhumane philosophies but we can show that what we have in vanta is Humane enlightened philosophies and they finally tell us that all other civilizations have impacted Indian knowledge systems but we can show that Indian knowledge systems impacted other civilizations so clearly we are seeing at the very top level two sets of claims one set of claim coming from the enforce narrative telling us all of these things about the Indian civilization whereas I as a scientist and engineer have worked for many many years examining the evidence from multiple disciplines and my research is showing something completely contrary to whatever has been enforced into our minds by ncrt and by other textbooks over the years so bear with me and we'll talk about this so first I'd like to talk to you about historiography who are the people who wrote the history of India Indians have been very happy with the concept of history that we have we talk about iasas puranas talap puranas epigraphy or the genealogy of families this has been our notion of History we have been very happy with it but when the colonial people when they came and they were trying to rule Indians they wanted to write a history of India that suits their purposes they wanted to show that Indians are backward primitive superstitious stagnant society and the British are forward they are progressive technologically advanced Society so they wrote history of India in a certain way way to put down the bhate civilization they were followed by eurocentric people they those Scholars wanted to address why are Sanskrit Latin and Greek related they found the relationships between Sanskrit Latin and Greek and they wanted to address why this relationship between these languages and so to address those questions they came about with several ideas that are eurocentric in uh in notion and they came with certain natives wherever the colonial people went the missionaries also were not far behind so the missionaries wanted to convert Indians into Christianity so they were the Forefront of translating Indian works the Sanskrit works on puranas on the ithas super nishit and other things they were trying to translate them into European languages and their translations also were in a motivated in a certain way to make Indians look primitive backward and so on since 1947 very unfortunately we have inherited neeran socialism socialism believes that uh the old order is corrupted and we change can come on the back of civiliz on on the Constitution for example if you have constitutional means bring in laws to restrict the old order and by destroying the old order they believe that change can come about so neeru and socialism came with socialist ideas in the Academia since 1947 since 197 2 the marxists have been controlling the education sector in India so they believe all of history is the history of class conflicts oppressor oppressed that is all all your vidanta is gone philosophy is gone everything is reduced to oppressor oppressed who oppressed whom who's a victim here and all of those kind of narratives of what has come in the Marxist narrative so they too believe that we can bring in a classless Utopia according to them by destroying the old order old order in India is Hinduism so by destroying Hinduism they believe that they can get a classless Utopia so these five Frameworks the colonial eurocentric missionary socialist and the Marxist they have hijacked the history of India imposed their ideologies on that and led to a subversion of our identity in the present in the present times none of us can recognize Who We Are Who our ancestors are in the narratives they say on who we are because that's that's how much they have corrupted the narrator so it's critically important to understand that these Frameworks are the ones that control the histography of India and these Corruptions have happened over 300 years Colonial Scholars missionaries eurocentric scholars in what I call Colonial hemony people like Portuguese Dutch French British hand inand with Christian imperialism people like calwell goop Pope and others hand inand with eurocentric Scholars people like Max mu Herber trly and so on so they've come about with certain convergent ideologies and have come about the notion of Arian Invasion or migration to India in 1500 BCE so the convergent ideas have resulted in things like that and if you think that these are relics of the past unfortunately for our Academia this is a received wisdom Colonial ideas are received wisdom additionally they put Outsider sociology on India and they use these sociological concepts that are relevant for the Western experience they've imported that into India the angry white male of the West has become the angry Brahman male in India however ill-fitting those models are but they use these failed models to talk about the Indian context though our historical experience is not the same as Western experience so anyway the uh leftist leaning socialist Academia and the Marxist Academia they work with archaeology today and with genetics where results are made to align with Linguistics chronology and once again with circular dependencies questionable assumptions it directly impacts the btia identity who we are as a civilization who are we as a people all that is impacted by these narratives so at a very high level these Outsider Frameworks Colonial eurocentric missionary socialist Academy of marxist they work with these primary ideas the first three work with the idea that Christianity is the only true religion and superiority of white Europeans the last two Frameworks Believe by destroying Hinduism we can get a classless utopian society and in the meantime they have shared interest to uphold Bible chronology show Hindus as primitive backward stagnant superstitious discriminatory show superiority of white Europeans promoting Christianity history from below sub alurn oppressor oppressed conflict Dynamics show class conflicts claim victimhood all these are the common ideologies which they find resonance with and so they are strange bed fellows but they work together to make this happen and in in Tamil Nadu we have the unfortunate dravidian ISM a derated framework that also shares similar ideas they believe that the dravidian people are not Hindus and they show the Hindus are Arians backward primitive and these kinds of things they work to promote Christianity and they claim victimhood today we have have from the West left to left islamism and bism these these constructs also uh Frameworks also have a bearing in today's discourse and they too in India want to show Hindus as primitive backward stagnant they want to amplify the voices from below subaltern and to claim victimhood everybody wants to be a victim in valkism so these are the kind of Frameworks their motivations to control the identity of the btia person it continues to the present day and we need to understand this if we have to understand anything that we're doing so you might wonder why am I talking about all this in a talk on Indian knowledge systems it's very important because this porous narrative Arian Invasion this fake narrative says Arians came to India in 1500 BCE they say these Nomads illiterate Nomads they didn't even have a script right so they were illiterate they just had oral tradition no script these illiterate Nomads from Central Asia they destroyed the superior haraba civilization and they running around in Northern India with cow Curry cast and all these kind of things and according to ncrt text India had to wait for Thousand Years for civilization to return to magada after they made contact with the Greeks once Maga made contact with the Greeks in 300 BCE suddenly we got the brahmi script suddenly we have Ashok and edicts and things like that and we became civilized overnight and then they say your civilization is a young one you have not had enough time for knowledge generation in mathematics astronomy medicine so if you have got Advanced knowledge in these areas you must have learned it from the older civilizations like the Greeks Babylonians Etc so this is what they say so they tell us that Arians brought Sanskrit from Central Asia into India the script brahi came from the Semitic script Arc from Israel Levant into India they tell us that astronomy came from Babylon into India they tell us that the Greeks thought us math and sciences they tell us that turkic Muslims they thought us culture Cuisine architecture music and civilization and they tell us the British they got us science technology and rational thought some people even say bti was T To Us by St Thomas who landed in Kerala so these are the kind of claims that are made on the Indian civilization so we see there is a denial of agency we are not allowed to talk about our own history the minute we say that we are pigeon hold by them as Hindu saffron and all these kind of ideas because they don't want to deal with evidence they don't want to deal with the truths that we are uncovering over here but Bottom Line This is what their narration of History has led to a gross Distortion of identity and growing divisive forces today in India based on spurious ideologies I call it a criminal Distortion of the history of the Indian civilization many people ideally should be behind bars for what they've done since 1947 to the present day in corrupting the Indian mind on who they are by masking the reality and presenting this uh notion of History they have to be behind bars but in in an enlightened civilization that's what we would do they have distorted all aspects of our civilization anchor points of chronology and every aspect of Indian knowledge systems and identity so I hope with this you have a background to understand how when we talk about Indian knowledge systems we have to keep in mind these present day narratives because the present day narratives will deny you your knowledge systems and I have been working on rebutting this kind of nonsense from marxists from socialists and colonialist and others for the last 15 years or 20 years and I make use of published evidence in scientific papers and journals and I bring an evidence-based history rational logical analysis of models data methods Frameworks and claims and I show that there is so much of data for history in India anywhere you go anything you take whether it's genetics climate records archaeology paleontology botony astronomy oral records religion Sciences so much of data is there in the Indian civilization and we can take this data and we can use various models that have been proposed things like linguistic model archaeology model genetics model astronomy model and using this we can try to explain the Indian context multi-dimensionally so that is what we're doing we're taking we're understanding what assumptions are there in each model where the data came for their studies what methodology they have used so we are going to look at uh several things the assumptions theyve used in each of these models the kind of data they've used the provence of the data where did it come from we're going to look at the methodology in those models what kind of methodology they've used with the best in class or are they questionable and we're going to look at the inferences and claims so we're going to have a logical rational understanding of the Indian civilization but in general what I do is I examine the I'm pioneering a model based analysis of histography where in taking a vesik kind of approach where we have a perception and inference praka anumana trying to understand Indian civilization on that that basis on a causal basis trying to look at the linguistic model textual model archaeological model so I have been pioneering a model based analysis of histography using Linguistics textual models archaeological models genetic astronomy Southern models everywhere I'm looking for or evidence-based Narrative of the Indian civilization and that is my methodology that I follow over here I take a look at the data data can be either high quality data medium quality data low quality data and I'm looking for a three tired investigation of Indian knowledge systems transmission either contact through migrations trade invasions evidence of transmitters of Indian knowledge systems through their Works evidence of use of Indian knowledge systems in foreign civilization and we show many many transmission methods so in my rebottle to enforce histography this is what I show from all of my evidence-based rational examination of facts I show in the textual evidence there is no memory of invasion or migration in any time frame whether you take works from Northern India from Southern India any time frame nobody here is saying that we came from Central Asia into IND we crossed the mountains and came here nobody's saying that we drove the people from the north to the south in the South nobody's saying we used to live in the North and we were Chase to the South nobody's saying we are Arians they are dravidians nobody's saying we are North Indians they are South Indians such kind of memory simply not there in any Indian work any period of time so this is the first thing that we see common sense in our own text don't have memory second archaeology in archaeology they say if a foreign culture has come into a a place we must see changes in the ceramic record in the pottery record maybe a new technology has come in and new style has come in so we can try to see in 1500 BC or so are there any changes in the ceramic record but in India there's absolutely no change some people have said ocp ochre colored pottery that is an indicative of Arians coming into India in 1500 BC but then okre curl is there from third millennium BC itself in India showing a continuity it is not something that Arians brought in then if you look at genetics so much of work has been done in genetics using fixation index using PCA studies using at mixture studies using either maternal mitochondria or the V chromosome or genome white analysis whole lot of Studies have been done and in my perspective there still is no discernable markers in the the genetic record that conclusively prove there's a foreign ad mixture of genes to the extent that they are describing Aran Invasion it is simply not there in the genetic record the genetic record says all present day Indians cannot be clustered into North Indian pool South Indian pool Brahman Gene chhatria Gene vishia Gene Arian dravidian we cannot divide the Indian population based on our genetics that is what the genetics is telling us we are all so thoroughly mixed that there is no way you can cluster into these buckets in climatology we know that there was a 200-year monsoon failure in 200 BCE that resulted in outward migration from India to the ferti Cent taking a lot of Indian knowledge systems with them we also know from geology and hydrology that there was a powerful Saras river that flowed from the Himalayas down to the ocean and this River because of plate tectonics movements in the northern northern India some of the tributaries like ctage that used to feed into sarasti stopped feeding sarasti and feed indas instead now and yamuna that used to feed into sarasti also changed course and sto feeding sarasti sarasti then dried up and we know from hydrology this drying up happened by 1900 BCE but then how can the Arians supposed Arians invade indan 15 BC write the Riga in India and talk about powerful sarasti river flowing from mountains to the ocean how is that possible that River doesn't even exist by the time the supposed Arians have come so this also is an indicator that Riga is talking about sarasti River that is very ancient indicating even before Arin supposed Arians had come in astronomy there is so much of astronomy in several of our texts our upanishads brahmanas aranyakas all these Works iasas they're all showing astronomical observations today we can take those astronomical observations and with science try to answer when were these observations made using the phenomenon of precision for example and they indicate great Antiquity some of the archo astronomical observations in Riga for example the story of Aditi that can be dated to 6,000 BCE the story of ashin that can be dated to 7,200 bcee the kuga 3102 BCE so this way we have got many many uh astronomy indicators that have got great Antiquity and you one must one must ask how is it that the Vic literature supposed to be written after 1200 BCE in India but has got memory of events going back thousands of years prior to that so collectively I show that by taking this multidisciplinary EV evidence we can have a rebuttal to ncrt style enforced hysterography and say that that is completely wrong what we're teaching our children the evidence is showing something else we can we can we can show that with evidence and rational examination of facts all right with that big background we can now go to Indian knowledge systems itself where we I would like to take up several areas the first area of Indian knowledge systems I like to talk about is Indian astronomy which We call joa joa shastra we have had such a long timeline of Discovery Innovations by various scientists in India over thousands of years so I'd like to document some of those things in this talk over here so briefly I'd like to give you a span of astronomy works like to talk to you about sources and text various sources and text we know that we have got texts from ancient times for example vas and brahmanas contain astronomy content we have puranas that contain stories with astronomy wisdom as metaphors we can show all of these things then we have got sidhanta Santas are mathematical astronomy works with mathematics and astronomy so many of them like Vasa Atri sidhanta parashar sidhanta Kapa Narada garya all these works are lost we don't have these texts anymore but we know they existed because of citation to them by later writers therefore we know that such mathematical Works existed in the past but we don't have them then vanga jsha we can date it to 1400 BCE and the person lagada he was the author of this work then works by bigara works Su sidhant we don't know the date for these works then several other lost Works pamar sidhant raka Santa sidhant sidhant we don't have these works today because because they're lost but baram he left commentaries of them and finded current ERA so we know what they contained going on from ancient to 1,000 current ERA from ancient to 1,000 current ERA we got for example arabat the first around 476 current ER who wrote araam Arya sidhant vamir who wrote pchas Santia we have got basar onean in 600 current ER who wrote The Bash on aryati now arya's works are so T that you need somebody with a PhD on writing a PhD thesis on aryaan that's what bascara did in his Basia on Arya bam brahmagupta who wrote brahmasutra sidhant bateshwar who wrote in 880 curent this this sidhant manula in 932 who wrote this work the second arabat in 950 current ER who wrote Maha sidhanta then from thousand current ER to, 1900 current ER we got bascara II in uan who wrote the famous sidhant shiromani then going on to Kerala School of mathematics parmeshar in 1400 Kar who wrote These Works nilak Sumaya who wrote Tantra sraa then Ganesh DNA and jesa who wrote yuk Basha then going on to odisa Chandra shikar samanta who wrote sidhant darpana and several others so what I've shown here is a continuous tradition of Indian astronomy going to very very ancient times I have just put some important writers over here there are hundreds and hundreds more of writers over here so clearly we have got accumulation of astronomy Works in India going back to very ancient times and once again some important Santas along with the geography where they were arabat was in Patna brahmagupta was in Rajasthan Basra the first was in Gujarat Lala in alwa again vesar in Gujarat this person ujan basar II in Karnataka bijapur nilaj in Kerala and kurukshetra varasi orisa so what we seeing is it is not as if knowledge was only in Northern India only in Southern India all over India our scientists were generating knowledge sharing this knowledge and building the Corpus of knowledge that is what we learn from from these works we know the westerners when they discovered Indian astronomy several of them were absolutely fascinated with Indian astronomy and the kind of timelines in it people like Cassini Le gentle oer Bailey Playfair Davis they were the first people to encounter Indian Works translated them and said Indian astronomy is very very ancient however soon after William Jones came along and he started the controversies he had observed commonality of Sanskrit Latin and Greek and they wanted to address why are these languages related therein was born the idea of Arian Invasion to India from Central Asia and Arians had to be in India in 1500 BCE and the Sanskrit literature was written after that so they asked how can Indian astronomy have that Antiquity if they wrote them from 1500 BC surely they can't have Antiquity going back in time so they preferred their linguistic models on the basis of which they questioned the Antiquity of Indian astronomy so everybody has shown in red font over here William Jones Bentley Whitney vber Max mu tbot NB and pingry these are some of the westerners who contest Indian astronomy the Antiquity of that based on the ideas of Arian Invasion for example whereas people like colbrook burges jacobe and others still were're convinced that Indian astronomy is very very ancient so these are some of the controversy how old is Indian astronomy where did it originate the controversy is only for the West at this point they also question what did Indians learn from the Greeks they presume that Indians learned from the Greeks and they asked a question what did they learn from the Greeks what did they learn from the Babylonians and the reason is Indian astronomy shows far greater Antiquity than suggested by Arian Invasion that comes from linguistic theories this is the reason but we can now show material evidence text story sidhanta in Indian astronomy and if we go looking for that we can see that in India astronomy was done to make sense of the sky the sky was a huge Celestial calendar and marking of time to understand phases of the moon movement through the ecliptic movement of the sun movement of planets and to keep time through Celestial calendar and we got evidence in archaeology itself in cashmir we see these Rock paintings with sun and moon in Karnataka we seeing this in Kashmir we're seeing the four cardinal points of astronomy maybe there's a supernova showing two suns in the sky and and such things and this famous madaro pashupati seal which abank thinks it shows the equinoxes and soulsters in 3,000 BC and these standing figurines over here are showing a planetary alignment that happened in 3102 BCE and moving forward we have got so many Stone circles for example in Andra Pradesh and places like that stone alignments and these are aligned along with the Equinox Direction it was a way for people to figure out when vernal equinox happens the sun must come back to a certain point and can we measure that using Stones keeping two stones and such things so there are scientists were trying to understand how these alignments are done with these stones to Mark the passage of time itself and we have got a great many number of stories stories in India encode astronomy wisd and we see that is the metaphor of Stories We have this Heritage if you take a DSLR camera and put it on a tripod after Sunset you point it to the Northern Hemisphere keep the shutter open after about half an hour or so you'll see you got these star Trails this star appears to be immobile in the sky it is not moving because the axis of rotation of the earth is pointing to this one this is Polaris or drua and all the other stars are going in bigger and bigger circles around so Indians had observed this and they maintained the story in the story of drua where drua when he was young he had an unhappy childhood his father had married a younger woman and the younger woman did not allow Dua to sit on his father's lap she pushes him away and he's so sad so he goes and do tapasia to Vishnu to when Vishnu comes he wants to ask him where is my place in the universe and when Vishnu comes he wants nothing but Vishnu says after your time I'll make you into a motionless star in the sky you'll be high above all or everybody else even the sapta rishis will go praak around you that is what Vishnu says and this is an encoding of this phenomena that I've shown over here the star trials that Dua is immobile in the sky everybody else goes in productiona around Dua so this rotation phenomenon of the earth is maintained in the Dua story then we have got the concept of UT and D this is very well known to Indians and they knew that from UTA to Daka the shadow of the Sun goes North and North and North northernmost point then goes southernmost point and they could estimate the length of the solar year based on that and they maintain that the story of Bria Bria is an Ashura who gets a bone from rudra rudra is like the Agni or sun that if he places his hand on a person's head that person must die rudra gives him that b and the minute he gets a bone as wants to see if rudra will die if he keeps his head hand on his head rudra runs and eventually there's a Divine Maiden who comes over there Ashura is attracted by the maiden and he wants to marry her she says you're an UNC fellow I'm not going to marry you he says no no no I can dance I know the Arts so she says follow my steps and while she's dancing she places her hand on her own head Ashura forgets about that bone and he puts his hand on his head and he falls dead he falls dead on the day of UT so this simple story here it is there in bhagwat Pana shat bhagwatam it is telling us about UT dakay is another name for the wolf it's a nocturnal animal it hunts at night and sleeps during the day when vka is chasing rudra that means the sun is running away and the Sun is running away the nights are becoming longer and longer days are getting shorter and shorter on the day of UT Bria is killed and the sun can come back that can grow back in size so these kind of stories have been maintain in our past and Indians had the very good idea about Equinox soul sesses and other such things we also have in matsa purana and other puranas the story of Chandra Chandra married the 27 Daughters of King Daka that is what we are told and promptly everybody starts laughing because Chandra is not a man how can you marry and all these things but we lose sight of what our ancestors wanted to tell us our ancestors were not idiots they knew they wanted to communicate some wisdom they observed that every day the moon appears over the Easter Horizon at a slightly different time today if it appears at 8:00 at night then the next day it might be 8:40 at night you might have the sun rising so they observed because of that the backdrop of stars against which the Moon is rising is different each day they observed that it takes 27 days for the moon to come back to the same star backdrop of stars so they divided the entire ecliptic into 27 segments in each of the segments they obser observed the principal Bright Stars over there and gave that the name of the moon's wives so they can remember them neonics the idea was Moon would visit one wife every night that was the thinking over here so this story is related to the 27.3 day siderial month and then the story also says Daka was Furious Daka is the father-in-law right he was Furious because he heard Chandra loves rohini more than the other wives and he is not happy about it how can you treat my daughters unequally so he curses them he says because of what you done you'll die Chandra you will die Chandra does not want to die he runs off to mahadeva and says mahadeva I don't want to die mahadeva says I can't change the curse but I will uh change it so that you after you die you'll once again grow in strength till you get full strength and once again you lose it so he says that you'll experience a life of waxing and veining this part of the story is related to to 29.5 day codic month so Indians are clearly aware that using the the moon we can have two calendars one is the siderial calendar on the nakshatra which is 27 days other one is on the Titi Titi is the phase of the of the moon this is 29.5 days approximately 30 days so they knew about both of them and both ideas were used in Indian calendars to Mark the passage of time so this is what I shown over here from from New Moon to New Moon is a codic month of approximately 30 days and the moon takes around 27 days to orbit the earth and this is a cerial month so the intellectual curiosity of our ancestors who wanted to reconcile the siderial month codic month along with the solar year that is what led to things like adikam Masa things like yugas 5year Yuga 19-year cycle samatar cycle chatur Yuga cycle all these were intellectual outputs of our ancestors to try to reconcile these various calendars to try to make them work together and we seeing for example even in Riga you can go as old as Riga we seeing astronomy there for example here in RVA 1.25.18 over there he also knows the moon of later birth so it's a reference to the codic months another place it says in Riga The Wheel of Time has 12 parts and 360 spokes or days or 720 pairs of days and nights very interesting in another place it says Vishnu or the sun sets in motion the wheel of three 120-day periods this is refering to three seasons now so what we seeing is that even at the BC stage itself we have concepts of astronomy coming there understanding of calendars and understanding of these things nakshatra and Rashi these were the Indian astronomy model and this helps to Mark the passage of time so these are the nakshatras like I said Indians divided the sky in 13 and 1/3 degree segments that 27 of them if you multiply 27 and 13 and 1/3 you get 360° so the names of the moon's vies chitra vishaka jesa these are all this Outer Circle as you can see Indians are also aware that you can have a lunar month so the concept of lunar month is if the full moon appears in the chitra nakshatra that month is called the chitra Masa in Northern India we use a full moon as a indicator in Southern India we use the Amasia or the new moon as a indicator that is why we see a slight offset between the chitra Masa of the full moon and and chitra Masa of the amanta Moon in addition to marking the passage of time using lunar months Indians are also interested in marking the passage of the Sun in order to Mark the passage of the sun we have the Rashi model where they divided the sky into 12 segments of 30° each and these are the familiar rashis Mina mesha visha and other such things these are the familiar rashis that we have so Indians could track the passage of the sun and the passage the moon and mark the passage of time using the nakshatras and Rashi model this is a listing of our nakshatras in two of our ancient books vanga joa and suryya sidhanta we can see the names are more or less the same all through the list over here and when the British came to India they identified what these are nakshatras are in relation to the Western constellation names so using the pundit's help cria was identified as ITA toi rohini as Alpha toi Misha as Lambda oranus and so on so today we can use Western uh constellation names and also and identify our nakshatras this shows to us how ancient the nakshatra model is it also shows to us that the the nakshatra model is common throughout India so whether you look in samskritam whether you look in Tamil Malayalam Gujarati telu Canada Hindi marati we seeing the the nakshatra name are the same throughout India except with small changes for example arra becomes tiad in Malayalam and in t or Ashia becomes aan so small changes are there but otherwise we're seeing that the nakshatra model or the astronomy model is common throughout India showing a pan Indian technology that is what we're seeing here and some people try to say that Rashi was copied from Babylonian ideas into India during V's time I have seen for example even in the Tanja in aatar Temple in taram in the temple ceiling we have got the rashis on the on the the the on the ceiling which I've taken this picture over here dated to around 1100 current ER and so on subash K also in an essay on Babylonian and Hindu astronomy he notes that we had the 12 Adias who are gradually replaced by the Rashi name in the first millennium BCE hinting that even these knowledge systems were there in India itself over a very long period of time so now we are in a position to talk about calendars Celestial coordinate systems and measurements knowing that Indians had the codic month using Titi and phases of the moon we had the cidial month using nakshatras we had the solar year using UT and D first of all Indians marked the passage of time using pun panga so in panchanga we use the notion of murta mura is 130th of a day or a 48 minute interval so typically at day rise that is how Indians determine the beginning of the day they would try to say what is the nakshatra which is cidial measurement what is the Titi that is codic measurement and what is the Vara or the week day yoga angle between Sun and Moon and Karana Titi by two so this was the way the that Indians Mark the passage of time during the day using the panchanga for example and we had the concept of week days we got the Ravi s mangala budhan Guru shukran Shani and the hint for why these names came about is there in Arya baa as well as Su sidhanta that talks about why the particular ordering is followed and we also had the concept of solar month and the lunar month like as shown earlier this is the Rashi model and these are based on whether the full moon or the new moon appears over a certain nakshatra I've shown here that we got 5,000 plus years of time constants and calendars for example one murta is 48 minutes 30 muras is one auratum or a siderial day of 24 hours 30 auratum is one Masa so we have 30 tiis there approximately 29.5 days or a codic month we have two MERS which is one Ru which is a season of approximately UH 60 days three Rus make one ionm either UTA D approximately 180 days two ionm make one Vera or a lunar year of 360 days and the rig V itself is talking about a year of 360 days and you might wonder Indians knew about the solar year of 365.24 days how does that reconcile to 360 days in the early days AAR says the shortfall was adjusted by conducting an atira sacrifice for 4.5 to 6 days during which you don't measure the passage of time but eventually ataa is saying the Rishi called rohita he created the adikam Masa even rig vaa 1.2 5.8 talks about that so clearly at some point in time the Ries had a mathematical procedure to figure out when an intercal m month should be inserted into the calendar so we got synchrony between the solar calendar and the lunar calendar this is the evidence that we see from uh from these works and if we take a look at the calendars used in India pan India Regional calendars we seen some parts of India the northern part the blue color over here uses the P amanta month Western we have the Western Amant Southern we use a southern amanta we also have a solar calendar in Kerala in Tamil Nadu in places in Andra odisha Bengal and so on so this is some remembrance from the purana genealogies that we have the chandrai and the Sury wami these could have been families that followed either the solar calendar or the lunar calendar so some remembrances there even today in India based on the kind of calendrical systems that we uh follow Indians also observed the 60-year samat Sara cycle they knew that Saturn takes approxim ately 30 years to complete one revolution and Jupiter takes about 12 years to complete one revolution so 30 * 2 or 12 * 5 is 60 that is a Resonance of Saturn and Jupiter when they both return to the same zodiacal plane so Indians observed that period periodicity also in a calendar called samsara cycle and this is followed throughout India we follow this kind of samsara cycle we also had various eras eras now measure from some point how many years have elapsed so what I've shown to you is in the panchanga we had the mahura we had the nakshatra of the day we had the Titi of the day we were we have we week days we have got lunar months solar months we had mutra D in a year in addition to all these things you might want to know how many years have elapsed so we used eras like the Kali Yuga era Buddha Nirvana we had Shak era Gupta era and shahana era so different eras have been there in India to Mark how many years of elapsed since some major event has occurred even that has been there and Indians in investigating the nature of time have done so many amazing things the shat bhagwatam for example is talking about Vic cosmology the Hindu cycle of time in which we have the concept of chatur Yuga a chatur Yuga has got four yugas Satya tra dwapara and kuga in 4 is to 3 is 2 is to one ratio so the one is 432,000 years which is koga's for duration multiply that by two you get 864,000 years which is dwapar Yuga multiply that by two you get tra Yuga multiply by two you get D Satya Yuga so the total is 4.32 million years that is the duration of a chat Yuga and Indians took thousand of them to form a Maha Yuga 71 of them for a mananara 14 of them to form a Kala or a creation event which takes 4.32 billion years this was seen as one day of Brahma is one kalpa just like one brahma's got one day he's also got one night of a similar duration during which prer or dissolution of the universe happens there's also a period of sya when nothing happens we are not accounted for that over here in the Indian thinking in shat bhagwatam we are in the 51st year of the current Brahma each Brahma lives for 100 such Brahma years so there's a staggering amount of time that our ancestors have been able to think in cosmology since creation has happened and how it's a recurrent creation that life will continue on Destroy continue on this ideas is encoded in shat bhagwatam and other works that talk about the cycle of time in India and we have had a long tradition of astronomical observations many many phenomena have been observed by our scientists our rashies for example they have observed solar and lunar eclipses we have for example Rishi Atri in Riga it says that he observed a solar eclipse but maybe that is not the end of the story what is so special in observing a solar eclipse anybody could observe a solar eclipse he has done something more than that tilak is talking about it I'll presently say how maybe Rishi Atri not only saw the eclipse he also predicted that the eclipse would occur meaning that he had a mathematical means understanding of the phenomena and trying to do these things so the uh this particular eclipse is supposed to be either 4677 BCE or 4202 BCE Arya butter is the one who tried to to explain the phenomena where you see if we had the plane of the sun called the ecliptic then the orbit of the of the moon is tilted at 5° from the ecliptic which means eclipses can only happen when these nodes converge so you can have a solar eclipse here or a lunar eclipse window over here so arabat called this ascending node is rahu and the descending node is ketu till then many people love laughed at how superstitious Indians were in thinking that some demon called rahu is swallowing the Sun but that was a metaphor and arabat clearly is showing what it means in terms of the geometry of the moon's orbit with respect to the ecliptic and arabat in his work arabaa he estimated the length of Earth's Shadow Moon's Shadow duration of the eclipse he had formulas he had formulas using which he could compute all these quantities so we are seeing that from Atri to Arya we seeing huge amount of knowledge over here I'd like to talk to you a little bit about Rishi Atri and the quadrant in this work Journal of Science in 1924 astronomy page 57 is a description of the solar eclipse of Rishi Atri so here they're referencing tilak's translation where he saying that maybe Atri use aa yantra aa yantra is a quadrant in locating the sun totally eclipse is then Riga in the fifth Mandela 40.6 it talks about this and uh tilak is interpreting the Tua to be this device that is shown over here that is a quadrant and quadrants were used even in China for example huge quadrants to measure the angle between the sun and moon for example is used in the Arabic culture also it is also used in medieval Euro so it looks like the rig bther talking about a three having used AA device in order to estimate the angle between the Sun and the Moon this is what we seen here in Orion tilak's work so Atri knew the eclipse Sun by Tua Brahma so he's interpreting that by means of tya so what does it mean so Atri had some instrumentation based on which is Computing the angle between the Sun and the Moon based on which he can say are we going to see an e Eclipse how many days later are we going to see the eclipse so he has understood the model what is the phenomena of eclipse how does it happen he has understood as an angle between Sun and Moon eventually converging to zero at the eclipse point and he has got a means of measuring it also if tilak's interpretation is taken this means Atri understood the phenomena of eclipse he had an instrument to measure the angles he had a predictive capability using prediction he could do that amazing that this was done in India in 4202 BCE or 6,000 years before now our ancestors were already observing eclipses and estimating how that would happen and arabat has explained to us uh the exact mathematics and so on what else did Indians observe they also observed Precision Precision is something that the Earth is doing the axis of rotation of the earth is tracing a circle in the sky that takes around 26,000 years to complete and Indians could estimate that also we'll talk about this a little later for example Su sidhanta it talks about this Indians also observe transits transits are the inner planets like Mercury and Venus from our perspective they go across the face of the Sun and this is a picture that I took in 2016 when Mercury was going across the face of the sun this little dot here is mercury so Indians observed they could estimate when Transit would happen and they use them to Define the models that they were using in the western experience only after Galileo had the telescope Kepler got a lot of data only then Europeans were in a position to predict a Transit of Venus as a first in the Western World whereas this was routine work in Ancient India Indians are doing these kinds of things here are two of our ancient scientists Malik arjin asuri from Andra Pradesh who had estimated this Transit phenomena and discussed about how Venus and Mercury appear here when they're going through the sun's surface kamalakara who was from Maharashtra he's even saying Mercury and Venus will look like holes on the sun remember he did not have any telescopes or things like that today if we look at the sun we know how difficult it is to see the Sun but he knows that these planets will look like holes in the sun if you take a look at the picture that I taken of uh of this one you see that this is how Mercury appears like a DOT a black dot over here a hole in the son so clearly kamalakara knew what he's talking about and uh so we we know Indians were doing this kind of thing for a long time they also observed planetary conjunctions when planets come close to each other or the moon and a planet or a moon the star come close to each other these are conjunctions it is called yud in Su sidhanta and we find these things Indians also observed occultation when the moon covers a star or some such thing nakshatra that was called an occultation I've explained why Chandra loved rohini more than his other wives that is related to the occultation phenomena I've discussed that in a tedex talk Indians also observed comets these are called dumu in the Indian context and we know the Riga ramayana Mahabharata parashara Viara vamir s Tamil Works they are all talking about various comets at various times but we don't know what these early comets were because the periodicity of comets is so great so comets from 12th century onwards can be estimated correctly but earlier comets we have no idea what are these comets that uh people have recorded in in in the literature over here so we have discussed a lot of things in astronomy so far I'd now like to tell you about the Precision phenomena how the Indian calendar requires revisions over time because of of the Precision phenomena I'd like to explain to you about that so if you take a look at this graphic over here Milan Co cycle we are seeing that the Earth in addition to rotation in addition to revolution around the Sun once and 365.24 days it is going through orbital cycle where the orbit is going from elliptical to Circular in 100,000 years or the axial Precision the axis of rotation of the earth is tracing a circle in the sky that takes 26,000 years or a change in obliquity from 21° to about 23 24° and 41,000 years so these are responsible for amount of radiant energy we get from the Sun therefore the ice ages drought periods we have but we are interested in Indian astronomy on the second cycle axial Precision because Indians always observed when veral Equinox comes what is the nakshatra at the veral Equinox point for example they might say critica was at the ver linox point today we know that it's no longer critica at w linox point because of precision because of precision things have moved on so we can date back in time and say critica was there in 2400 BC for example Indians knew all of these things they knew the cardinal points of astronomy winter solce summer soulsters veral equinox automn Equinox they knew the reference planes Horizon ecliptic equator they knew reference points Celestial pole north south east west and so with all these things we can now have a coordinate system where they can locate stars in the sky so today we have many coordinate systems for example we can have equatorial coordinate system that rotates with the Earth's rotation or we can have altitude aimo coordinate system such things are used for telescopes and so on but ancient Indians use the ecliptic coordinate system where where the vernal equinox that point marked the Zero longitude for Indians so the Zero longitude for ancient Indians is the vernal equinox position and we know the vernal equinox changes with precision as Precision slowly changes where is the veral equinox point for the Zero longitude that too changes with time for example Misha that was at burle kinox in 4,000 BC 6,000 years ago r was there in 3,000 BC cria was there in 2,300 BC we know this because of precision we know that Indian calendar must keep changing because of precision so Su sidhanta is saying the circles of the nakshatras asterisms rotates 600 times in a chatur Yuga so what it says is it moves from 0 to 27° back to 0 - 27 back to 0 and this is the kind of rot a that is there explain the Su sidhanta I've taken this data from Professor ml Raja aasra search in kator where is showing Yuga has got 4.32 million years in 4.32 million years we complete 600 revolutions that means it takes 7,200 years per Revolution Indians called this Precision phenomena as I a chel so if you take 600 multipli by 27 multiply by these four segments going to 0 to 27 to back to 0 minus 27 back to 0o four segments are there multiplied by 60 to convert it to minutes multiplied by 60 to convert it to seconds divided by a chatur Yuga 4.32 million years the answer is 54 Arc seconds a year amazing accuracy in Su sidhanta that is talking to you how much does a Precision change every year if I keep my fist in the sky it is extending 15° in the sky if I extend just my pinky in the sky at arms length that is 1° in the sky now I want you to imagine we are not talking about one degree we not talking about 1 minute we talking about 54 Arc seconds that is such a small number that is how much it changes Equinox position changes year upon year our Indians were able to measure that estimate that and Su sidhant has got a figure for of 54 arcs a year you might also wonder what about other civilizations did they also know about Precision well we can take a look in this table Su sidhanta I'm not going to put a date on it the estimate is 54 AR seconds a year parashar sidhant has got about, 1400 BC according to Professor Arna iner it is quoting the same figure I think it is copied it from Su Sant Vaga Professor rankar is showing Vaga approximately 8 BCE he had an estimate for precision at 36 Ark seconds a year by the time he come to hipparchus in Greek tradition 120 BCE he has copied the Indian figure directly and he to says 36 Arc seconds a year in China yuk see in 3 307 current ERA he had a figure of 72 arccs a year greatly in error Arya butter had got it to 48 Arc seconds a year which is closer than SU sidhant the actual figure is 50.4 arcs a year Su sidhant is off by four AR seconds but arabas off by just two AR seconds the Arabs they copied wholesale all the Indian Works they took Su sidhanta translated that and that's how they got their knowledge so they also echoing Su Santa's value of 54 arcs a year munala estimated approximately 60 arcs a year basara II had a very very accurate figure at 48.6 arcs a year by the time patani samanta chandrasekar 1900 using naked eye observations he had a figure of 49.79 arcs a year this is what should be amazing to us that our Indians invested a lot of mental energy to understanding precision and they were able to estimated to these various figures through the times and we also know about 5,000 years of instruments used to measure the skies we know in haraa for example we had the water clocks this is also mentioned in vanga joa Arya so he's talking about all of these instruments that we see here by the time you come to vam he has also got graphical calculations the way students do XY graph today he had graphical calculations also brahmagupta has got a whole lot of quadrants like the tya goola and other such things basar is the one basar the first is talking about circular platform with graduated circumference I believe this is very similar to what I saw in Lal in lual I saw this uh brick circular platform which nobody there knew what it was but by reading basara's description I believe there the same thing there in lual itself showing how ancient this is laala had the armillary sphere by the time he come to Mahindra Suri we talking about Islamic times he had the astrol Maharaja J Singh used European instruments itself so we have got evidence in India with more than 5,000 years of measuring the skies this is the evidence that we have remember that if our scientists are measuring the skies measurement implies some kind of mathematics it implies we're going to use it some kind of model it implies some kind of predictive capability or some kind of mathematics sidhant that's going to be used so we have to show that measurements lead to modeling and prediction we have to show evidence of mathematical modeling for astronomy and we see that in the so-called rule of three it is there in lagadas vanga joa which is dated to 1400 BCE so over here rig vanga yaj vanga it says the rule of three to obtain the desired result should be applied again and again to the day so for simplification I've shown this equation a by B = to C by X where X is the unknown quantity with cross multiplication we get X is equal to b c by a this is what vanga jtia is saying in other words if Mars is over there in two days time Mars moves by Delta s so delta T is 2 days and Delta s is the distance it has moved so much I want to know in 8 Days time where will Mars be so that is the problem that vanga jsh has taken up and I've shown this over here here let a planet move Delta s units in delta T time then in time T how many units does it move and the answer is what Vang jsha is saying and he's saying apply this answer again and again the known result apply it again and again so you can keep predicting even for one year if you like it may be in error but you can do the prediction this our ancestors were doing in, 1400 BCE that is the evidence from vanga jtia and we have evidence that remember the sky is curved so if we do linear straight lines we are going to have errors in that so our ancestors have already observed there are errors we have to get better accuracy so trigonometry was invented the westerners say hipparchus is the father of trigonometry but that is absurd because they only had this this is a cord table this is not trigonometry trigonometry is right angle triangles this is described in Su sidhant this is described in araba so Indians had trigonometry the Greeks did not have trigonometry they had Cod tables and Indians were able to do very refined estimates of the Skies using these trigonometry and so on and we have evidence of the desire for more and more accuracy in the modeling if you take a look at the historical record ARA buta used linear interpolation Basra the first had analytical formulas of sinx brahmagupta in brahmasutra sidhanta he's talking about second order interpolation and by the time he come to Kerala madava he has got infinite series expansion for sinx cos x tan inverse X implying that there's evidence of observation modeling refinement Indians are not happy once you have a model I cannot predict well enough they try to understand why is the error there and they had some novel inventions using which they were able to get better and better accuracy the evidence is there in the record that we see over here Indians also had a planetary model they understood the planet movements and they wanted to have a model of the planet movements how is it moving around and so on so forth and westerners thought that Indians did not have a planetary model for example David pingry who was a professor in New York he said arabat did not observe and he wanted to know how is it that he arrived at mean motions that are so correct and the answer a simple according to him he used Greek tables of mean motion to compute the longitudes so in other words he presumed arabat did not observe one second he presumed that Arya copied from the Greeks I've already shown to you that Arab had a number of instruments using which he was measuring clearly he was observing the sky clearly he was making measurements and so on and we also know that Arya had referred to the works of earlier Indian scientists like like parashara and others and uh so we had a lot of data from that so parashara's work in 1400 BCE so what we are seeing this is a work by Professor aenar first he dates this scientist to the same time as vanga joa which is 1400 BCE and we seen parashara's work path of mercury he's talking about that he's talking that Jupiter traveling two and quarter nakshatras in one year leads to good crops this is a mathematical data we know that each nakshatra is 13 and 1/3 de so he's saying Jupiter travels 2 and quarter nakshatras in a year this is a mathematical piece of data which has been used by Arab buta then he says Saturn travels through the 27 nakshatras for 28 years this is also mathematical data that results in approximately 30 years that is Saturn's orbital period that is contained over here similarly for Venus even for Venus according to him it is the cycle is 591 days but today we know it's around 584 days so there's some data over here even for Venus path and things of this Nature by the time we come to su sidhanta su sidhant has got a lot of mathematical data in a Maha Yuga it says how many Revolutions of the sun 4, 320,000 of the Moon of mercury of Venus so there are a lot of mathematical data given here in Sant which we can put into a t tabular form to understand for example Sun how many Revolutions in a mahay yoga 4.32 million years and we can compute the mean daily movement of that object for example sun is 59 minutes 8 seconds and so on Mercury is 4° 5 minutes 32 seconds Venus is 1 minute 1° 36 minutes and so on so our ancient ient Indians clearly had enough of data to tell you the planetary model how much is it going to move day by day how much is a movement and so on and to get this we have done this daily mean motion is number of revolutions Maha yoga divided by number of days in mahay Yuga multiply by 360 you'll get these data that I've talked about from Su sidhant Indians also had a planetary model based on epicycles Arya is talking about that where Earth is at the center Center moon goes around the earth Mercury goes around the Earth but it has got a cycle of its own called an epicycle Venus goes around the earth it's also got a cycle of its own called epicycle so on Mars Jupiter Saturn and so on and this is a pulsating epicycle Contracting and expanding and by observing this we can see evidence of spherical geometry trigonometry measurement devices prediction tracking mathematical equation modeling error correction approximation parameter fitting all this is evident because there's no way Arya B can use such a complicated model without all of this mathematical artifices to try and tell you how things move so this is what we can recover from today's understanding of math by the time we come to nilakanta suaj in 1400 in Kera School of Math we are seeing that they did not stop saying achara Arab bata's already got a model I'm not going to change it they did not do that they observed that problems in the model and they Tred to refine that and make it better and better so their model was Earth is at the center moon goes around the earth sun goes around the Earth but Mercury Venus Mars Jupiter Saturn are going around the Sun and sun with all these planets is going around the earth this is a partial heliocentric model so we seeing that this model was used by taob BR in Europe 150 years after nilakanta had proposed this in in India so we are seeing a dynamic tradition of knowledge is taking place in India then this work is trying to show us how accurate the Indian epicycle modelist compared to the Greek model this is by Dr Anil Naran and he's showing for example if you take a look at the error profile for solar long longitude he's showing that in the year 2000 and the year 100 the strong line is the error in the Indian epicycle model and the dotted line dash line is the error in the Greek epicycle model we can see that the error in the Greek model is much greater than the error in Indian model showing Indian epicycle was far more accurate then also the colonial historian brand in 1896 he studied these things in Sury sidhanta and he said the epoch of su sidhanta appears to be made around 3,500 BCE according to brennand and Anil Naran did a simil simulation study to see when will the error be smallest using the Indian model so he showed the Indian model error is so great in 2,000 hour time 100 current error 1,000 BC error is going down 3,000 BC error is going down when heent to 5,000 BC you can see the error is the smallest the small line over here that is error so he tried to show that the error in the Indian model is leased in this time frame so what we learned by looking at this is that Indians had a sophisticated epicycle model with a pulsating epicycle far superior to the Greek model in terms of accuracy and prediction and this also calls out the bluff of Professor pingry and the others who said Indians did not have a planetary Theory and so on clearly Indians had a planetary Theory clearly Indians had trigonometry whereas the Greeks only had C tables and things like that and we have had greatly accurate uh ways of of estimating the Motions of uh planets and other other Heavenly Bodies we have had a long tradition of mathematical astronomy works I'm going to show you some selected Works in astronomers first thing first we know that there is 5,000 years of innovation we've got for example laga in 1400 BC bod Kay pingala we'll see their Works a little later and we have seen that mathematics development was arrested in the North after Islamic invasion it moved to the South under the protection of the vijayanagar Empire it died in the South too after colonialism came so we seeing people like arabat vam brahmagupta all of them thrived in Northern India before the Islamic invasions Basra II in ujan is the last that we have of the great around 1185 current ERA after that the Islamic invasions put an end to scholarship in Northern India but then it moved to the South under protection of J Naga madwa sagr parameswara nilakanta so they continued the tradition of Indian knowledge systems but that too died out after 17th century kamalakara and others thanks to colonialism so we are seeing the tradition of Indian Knowledge from very ancient times interrupted by Muslims later interrupted by Colonials and is completely died out today so arabat is one of the greats that we're talking about kapura he wrote this famous work called Arya batia this contains a whole lot of chapters on mathematics and astronomy and so on he talked about rotation of the earth eclipses epicycle model for solar system he also had a powerful Kuka algorithm to solve equations of the kind ax - b y = to C he had these uh uh summation 1 square 2 square up to n Square 1 square 2 square up to n CU so many intellectual accomplishments can be attributed to Arab buta one of the best SCI perhaps you had for a long time V so his importance is he wrote commentaries on these works this Paha sidhant Vish sidhant raka sidhant Su sidhant and it is important because some of these Works don't exist anymore but we know what it contained because of V's commentaries on them brahmagupta who studied the works of his predecessors Arya Bataan lad DEA V and the others he wrote br put a sidhant and other works these were taken by the Arabs when they conquered Sy and they took this work to Arab to bad where they were able to Translate into Arabic that's how they learned mathematics that's how they learned astronomy through Indian Works solution of linear quadratic indeterminate equations rules for zero operation interpolation formulas lot of astronomy then basar the first in 600 current ERA who wrote A Basia on araba who had had this functional formula for sinx and basar II who used to live in bijapur but he went to ujan and became a professor in the in the University there and uh his biggest work was sidhant shiromani where he's talking about elements of differential calculus and many other interesting works madava of srag grama from Trish all these infinite series I've shown here were proposed by him and he's the founder of Kerala School of astronomy where they worked on infinite series calculus trigonometry algebra iterative solution of equations and siki Raju says madava mathematics was transmitted to Europe one century before Newton and others knew about it through the Syrian Christian church and so on very interesting to see that so in madava school we are from madava parameswara damoda nilakanta Sagi JRA Deva and others so these were the people who belonged to the school so with that I'd like to close out the astronomy by also talking to you about the Antiquities scen in Indian astronomy so this is paradoxical because linguistic analysis says that Arians came to India in 1500 BCE and composed the Sanskrit Works in India if that is true then how can we have Indian astronomy showing great Antiquity that is what I'm going to highlight over here the first is what is the antiquity of the book vanga joa many people try to date this Weber to 500 BC William Jones 1100 BC locomania tilak K Brook dikshit dikshit came closest at 1400 BCE and to simulate this we had to First understand what is the astronomical phenomena that is that we can use in vanga jtia and abanka shows that it is vanga jsha it states winter solst occurred when the Sun and Moon came together in the Danisha nakshatra so we have to see when was Winter Soul SCE in the Danish nakshatra it no longer is true today because of the Precision phenomena so we had to go back in time to see that the previous slide we saw how Professor abay Anar said vanga joa contains a line that says sun and moon came together in winter solce in the Danish nakshatra so we want to simulate when is that possible so what you're seeing here is a planet Anum software with the projection of Earth's latitudes and longitudes on the sky which become Celestial coordinates and the center point over here the celestial North Pole and these circles that you see are the celestial latitudes if you will I'm using simple terms here and these are Celestial longitudes if you will it's called right Ascension and declination these are the words used in astronomy for these things but anyway so this line here is a ground line this is the north side east side west side and South is towards you so you're looking at the northern Skies if you will if we count from here 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 on Earth zero is a equator in the sky it becomes Celestial equator then from uh from zero we have minus 10 - 20 - 24 so when the sun is at -4 we notice gone to the southernmost point the solce point which is winter solce at that winter solce we want to see what is the nakshatra on that longitude we see Danisha over here so in order to get Danisha at the winter solce position I've had to crank the astronomy software back to 1440 BCE that is how we say vanga jsha and lagada should be dated approximately around 14400 to 1440 BC that's a timeline of that uh put person so Rishi Yaga in chatata brahmana he says cria never swerves from the East Direction therefore the Vic practitioner can light his yagya fires under the kka nakshatra that is what he write in chapat Brahma how do we interpret this message balaga the tilak tried to point it out saying that this is refering to helal rising of critica at the Equinox point so what we are seeing here is if you if you crank it back to 2982 BCE again from 90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Zer is a Celestial Equator this is the ground line so when the sky is still dark the Vic practitioner has his ritual bath comes outside looks to the east Direction he sees the kka nakshatra there then one hour later the sun rises and it washes out cria but no problem he's got a straight line he knows the two points he puts a Vic bricks under cria and lights it in that East Direction so this is what was meant when cria never SS from East Direction this can be dated to a staggering 2982 BCE in shatat Brahma this is the timeline that we associate now based on astronomy for Rishi Yaga then we have an ancient teap that is encoded in our tables for example many of our puranas talk about kuga then we have Arya sidhant refering to zok Pula sidhanta brahmagupta albaron all refer to the zok iol temple epigraphy in Karnataka that also refers to the zok the mathematician astronomer called Cassini he got some tables from Thailand from another French explorer and uh he sent it to Cassini to study and he said that these s tables seem to be having the longitude of Banaras and also they has an absolute date encoded there in February 18th midnight 3102 BCE that was cini's observation then Playfair later on Playfair Bentley colbrook burges all of them deter the same Epoch referred to in Su sidhanta also to the same timeline it turns out to be a conjunction of planets sun and moon in the RTI nakshatra is this the same that we typically identify as RTI nakshatra today for example and this is the data that is there in Su sidhanta that they try to make use of I simulated this this in this planetarium software going to February 18th 3102 BCE what we're seeing is the sun is now in the RTI nakshatra that is over here and we seeing that Guru that is Jupiter shukr and Venus are almost on top of each other clustered here Chandra is over here and we're seeing mangala Mars is here Buddha Mercury is here Shani is a little far away but still almost in the same area Saturn so this kind of a clustering in the RTI nakshatra has not happened in the last 26,000 years or so except in this 3102 BCE so the question now comes how did ancient Indians encode this particular phenomena did they back calculate that if they back calculated that it calls for enormous accuracy of planetary models that kind of accuracy did not exist this means Indians have a rembrance of this phenomena and that cultural memory has been passed on generation to generation and has been encoded for us and now we can crank it back in time and look at this particular phenomena going forward we have in Riga the story of Aditi we know that Aditi along with the co- sister diti they married the Rishi Kapa and through them we have the dasas and the Dias for us the interesting thing is in the Ia Brahman of the Riga translation by Martin hog in this in the second chapter we are seeing a very cryptic passage over here it says the sacrifice or the yagya went away from the devatas the devatas were unable to perform any further cermony remember that in the old India we looked at the skies to figure out when to perform a certain cermony so they were not able to perform it they did not know where it had gone to they said Aditi let us know the sacrifice through thee Aditi says tastu but I will choose a bone from you they said choose she chose this bone all sacrifices will commence with me and end with me so this is a very cryptic passage in IA Brahman where we are trying to figure out what exactly is going on over here again balag ganga tilak came to the rescue and he said that this is referencing a time when Indians were confused in their calendar their calendar was no longer relevant because of the effect of Precision Precision over thousands of years results in your nakshatras not being where they're supposed to be and so on so Indians are confused and they have reset the calendar to Aditi and Aditi is saying vernal equinox will begin with me and end with me that is what she's saying ver Li knocks begin with me and end with me so tilak pointed this out and he said we should Now look for when did veral equinox occur at what is what we know as Aditi Aditi for us comes in the punarvasu nakshatra punarvasu nakshatra has got two stars one is Aditi other is diti in the Greek tradition these are called caster and Pollocks the twin stars so to crank this back in time I to go to 6,000 BCE in 6,000 BCE we are seeing the Sun is the veral econox position and the longitude there is punarvasu so the Rick VC story that talks about Aditi can be dated to almost 8,000 years the important thing for us is it is telling us there was some calendrical system that Indians are using at that period of time and over thousands of years that calendar is useless because of the effect of precision they have been confused and they that is what has come out in this particular aspect and uh we can look at the Staggering period of time we're talking about over here one more story for the Antiquity of Indian astronomy this is now the Ashwin so the they appear in RVA Maranda purana maturana and so on so we are told in the Riga that sua his spouse was sanjana and through them we have the Yama yumy and so on but One Fine Day Surya becomes so hot that his wife could not take the heat so sanjina abandons her husband she goes off to the cooler region according to what we learn but then she leaves a shadow CH in her place One Fine Day Surya discovers the deception and asks cha where is my wife and she says she's gone to the cooler region so Sun Also goes to cooler region that is what it says in the Ric story we understand that when the sun is gone to the cooler region it means it's gone to the Sou most point which means his winter Soul SS in the Northern Hemisphere and he finds that she's taken the form of a m and he too takes a form of a horse and the ashiri kumaras are born as a result of that Union this is what we are told at the same time we also have verses in the Riga that says usas usas is a goddess of dawn so usas awaken the ashin for their share of the Vic sacrifice so this is very clear it means that ashin are appearing at dawn heliacal Rising with suria when suria is in the winter Soul SCE position this is what balag tilak says look for the point when Ashwin appear with sun at dawn heliacal rising in the winter solers point that is what we look for and when I simulated this this goes to a staggering 7,200 BCE when you go to that period of time now we can see from 90° here this is 0° the celestial equator - 10 -20 - 24 when the sun is a Celestial equator when ashin are in the longitude it has got to be this time frame 7,200 BC so this is the Antiquity of the rig VC story that is talking about Surya this is what we decide from this and amazingly I've got a correlation of the story corroboration of the story rather with a scientific paper that came out one year back in 2022 in nature that is talking about a solar flare that is bigger than anything we have known that happened precisely in 7176 BCE how do they know it with such prec Precision because when the solar flare happened at that great magnitude the there was there was proton activity in the northern and southern poles because magnetic lines of force conduct the charged particles there and there's been isotopic content created the upper atmosphere resulting the Northern Light Southern Lights and that has preserved the ice core record in Antarctica Greenland scientists have drilled the ice course they studied these things and they've said that suddenly in 7176 BCE the isotope contents are so great unimaginably great in that time frame so that's when I read that paper I said oh my goodness this is exactly the same thing we're talking about in the story the time frame matches perfectly even in India we have the remembrance Surya suddenly became brilliant so brilliant that sanjina could not take the heat she goes away and her father vishwak Karma comes and chops off the sun's Brilliance and then after some time Surya is able to bearable this bearable that is what we are told in the Indian story using science we can explain this perfectly I recommend that you take a look at the story called Once Upon a Time 9,000 years ago on Raj v.m medium.com I discuss this in great detail there or you take a look at the YouTube video called fascinating facts of Indian astronomy by on suum talks on that also I discussed this in great detail along with discussion of the papers that show the corroboration independent collaboration by science as well as our as archo astronomical observation over here fascinating for me because the validation of what we are saying so this date now like we say is 7,200 BC or 9,200 years before present so with this we can now rebut untenable Western assertions the westerners have spent much effort to discredit Indian astronomy because they knew Indian astronomy contains great Antiquity how can they explain that if they want to promote the linguistic analysis linguistic analysis in order to explain why Sanskrit Latin and Greek are related they've come about with a notion that there's an AR Invasion and there was a Proto indoeuropean ancestral language from which Sanskrit is derived if those facts are true then Iran Invasion must happen in 1500 BCE that is why Max meller said chanda's period Mantra period Sutra period all this is when Vic literature was composed in in India from 1200 BC to 200 current ERA he stuffed everything over there if that is true how can the Vic text contain astronomy showing the this great Antiquity there's a problem over there so the Western approach to this was they discredited all of Indian astronomy they said all Indian works are unreliable we can't use it therefore the linguistic theory is correct so this is one way to deal with it when you have inconvenient facts instead of analyzing the data you say it's unreliable and throw it out so that's what I am shown over here in Max Miller's chronology chandra's period is the earliest books of rig the Mantra period remaining books Brahma period 600 BC when all the brahmanas upanishad aranyakas were made Sutra period is when things like astronomy vanga joti and others were composed but we have seen in astronomy even K Brook himself said vanga jsha should be dated to 14400 BC where is that and where is the 200 BC of linguistic analysis we have seen cria and chapat brah to 2982 BC where is that at where is 600 BC of linguistic analysis we have seen Ric stories of Aditi and ashin going to 7,200 BC where is that and where is the chandus period of 1000 BC so clearly Indian astronomy has got the greatest uh potential to discredit the linguistic analysis and the dates deriving from there on it turns out that Max mu was confronted with this by his fellow Europeans who asked him should all of Indian chronology be held hostage to the Bible's chronology he got so upset with that question he wrote an entire book on that this on Ancient Hindu astronomy in this book he tried to explain that all the Indian works are unreliable and he's not able to accept a single date out of that and he basically discarded all the Indian Works having set the standard these are the views that are used even by some Indian Scholars today they blindly take Max Mueller's ideas and say Indian astronomy is unreliable but today we know this is a failed methodology called confirmation bias so max Mueller had belief system where he believed in the Bible's creation date of 404 BCE by his own admission he believed in that he also believed from Linguistics that Arians came to India in 1500 bcee he was okay with K Brook's date of 1400 BC for vanga jtia because that is after the Arian Vision so he accepted these things but he discarded all this evidence that was staring at him as unreliable so we know that this is confirmation bias it's evidence of failed methodology in colonial scholarship by extension today's Academia that uh exalts Max M's views they're also using a failed methodology to uphold the linguistic analysis
