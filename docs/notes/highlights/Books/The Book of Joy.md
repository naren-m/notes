### Highlights

- In fact, we may cry more easily, but we will laugh more easily, too. Perhaps we are just more alive. Yet as we discover more joy, we can face suffering in a way that ennobles rather than embitters. We have hardship without becoming hard. We have heartbreak without being broken.” ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=196))
- We create most of our suffering, so it should be logical that we also have the ability to create more joy. It simply depends on the attitudes, the perspectives, and the reactions we bring to situations and to our relationships with other people. When it comes to personal happiness there is a lot that we as individuals can do.” ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=222))
- “Sometimes I do meditation on the nature of self using what is known as the ‘sevenfold analysis,’” the Dalai Lama said. ([Location 291](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=291))
- Buddhist contemplative practice in which one searches for the true nature of the self by analyzing the relationship between oneself and the physical and mental aspects of our body and mind. “For example,” the Dalai Lama continued, “now when I look at you, and I analyze, I see that this is my dear, respected friend Bishop Tutu. No, this is his body, not himself. This is his mind, but not himself.” The Dalai Lama leaned in to emphasize his point, presenting a paradoxical riddle as old as Buddhism. “Where is Bishop Tutu’s self? We can’t find it.” He slapped the Archbishop’s forearm playfully. ([Location 292](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=292))
- “So now,” the Dalai Lama concluded, “in quantum physics, they also have a similar view. Any objective thing does not really exist. There is nothing ultimately we can find. This is similar to analytical meditation.” ([Location 297](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=297))
- Buddhist master Shantideva, who wrote, “If something can be done about the situation, what need is there for dejection? And if nothing can be done about it, what use is there for being dejected?” ([Location 461](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=461))
- “Pain is inevitable; suffering is optional.” ([Location 478](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=478))

- Was it truly possible to experience pain, whether the pain of an injury or an exile, without suffering? There is a Sutta, or teaching of the Buddha, called the Sallatha Sutta, that makes a similar distinction between our “feelings of pain” and “the suffering that comes as a result of our response” to the pain: “When touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed, ordinary person sorrows, grieves, and laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical and mental. Just as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and, right afterward, were to shoot him with another one, so that he feels the pain of two arrows.” It seems that the Dalai Lama was suggesting that by shifting our perspective to a broader, more compassionate one, we can avoid the worry and suffering that is the second arrow.

- There’s a Tibetan saying: ‘Wherever you have friends that’s your country, and wherever you receive love, that’s your home.’” ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=492))
- There are going to be frustrations in life. The question is not: How do I escape? It is: How can I use this as something positive? ([Location 502](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=502))
- suffering, frustration, are not the determinants of who we are. ([Location 515](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=515))
- “Too much self-centered thinking is the source of suffering. A compassionate concern for others’ well-being is the source of happiness. ([Location 577](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=577))
- We shrivel when we are not able to interact. ([Location 711](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=711))
- without other human beings. So the best way to fulfill your wishes, to reach your goals, is to help others, to make more friends. “How do ([Location 736](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01CZCW34Q&location=736))
