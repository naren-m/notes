### Highlights

- Einstein’s general theory of relativity, put forth in 1916, gives us our modern understanding of gravity, in which the presence of matter and energy curves the fabric of space and time surrounding it. ([Location 47](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MAWT2MO&location=47))

- The German physicist Max Planck, after whom these unimaginably small quantities are named, introduced the idea of quantized energy in 1900 and is generally credited as the father of quantum mechanics. ([Location 55](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MAWT2MO&location=55))
- [[Boson]]s, by the way, are named for the Indian scientist Satyendra Nath Bose. The word “lepton” derives from the Greek leptos, meaning “light” or “small.” “Quark,” however, has a literary and far more imaginative origin.

- [[Quarks]] are quirky beasts. Unlike protons, each with an electric charge of +1, and electrons, with a charge of –1, quarks have fractional charges that come in thirds. ([Location 88](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01MAWT2MO&location=88))
