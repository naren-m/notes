### Highlights

- “Some people are great when things are going well, but they fall apart when things aren’t.” ([Location 166](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=166))

- Why were the highly accomplished so dogged in their pursuits?
  - For most, there was no realistic expectation of ever catching up to their ambitions.
  - In their own eyes, they were never good enough.
  - They were the opposite of complacent.
  - And yet, in a very real sense, they were satisfied being unsatisfied.
  - Each was chasing something of unparalleled interest and importance, and it was the chase—as much as the capture—that was gratifying. ([Location 171](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=171))

- In sum, no matter the domain, the highly successful had a kind of ferocious determination that played out in two ways.
  - First, these exemplars were unusually resilient and hardworking.
  - Second, they knew in a very, very deep way what it was they wanted.
  - They not only had determination, they had direction. ([Location 175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=175))

- It was this combination of passion and perseverance that made high achievers special. In a word, they had grit. ([Location 177](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=177))

- After all, why shouldn’t the talented endure? Logically, the talented should stick around and try hard, because when they do, they do phenomenally well. ([Location 194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=194))

- I came to a fundamental insight that would guide my future work:
  - Our potential is one thing.
  - What we do with it is quite another. ([Location 261](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=261))

- Darwin was the first to explain diversity in plant and animal species as a consequence of natural selection. ([Location 349](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=349))

- So it’s worth pausing to consider Darwin’s opinion on the determinants of achievement—that is, his belief that zeal and hard work are ultimately more important than intellectual ability. ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=351))

- The normal response to being puzzled about something is to say,“I’ll think about this later,” and then, in effect, forget about it.
  - With Darwin, one feels that he deliberately did not engage in this kind of semi-willful forgetting.
  - He kept all the questions alive at the back of his mind, ready to be retrieved when a relevant bit of data presented itself.

- Reflecting on the achievements and failures of close friends and colleagues, and how the quality of his own efforts varied on his good and bad days, James observed: Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. Our fires are damped, our drafts are checked. We are making use of only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources. ([Location 369](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=369))

- But these outer boundaries of where we will, eventually, stop improving are simply irrelevant for the vast majority of us: “The plain fact remains that men the world over possess amounts of resource, which only very exceptional individuals push to their extremes of use.” ([Location 376](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=376))

## Case studies

### Enron - Energy company

- Enron employees prove that they were smarter than everyone else inadvertently contributed to a narcissistic culture, with an overrepresentation of employees who were both incredibly smug and driven by deep insecurity to keep showing off. It was a culture that encouraged short-term performance but discouraged long-term learning and growth. The same point comes through in the postmortem documentary on Enron called, appropriately enough, [[The Smartest Guys in the Room]]. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=485))

- Enron’s CEO. Skilling developed a performance review system for Enron that consisted of grading employees annually and summarily firing the bottom 15 percent. In other words, no matter what your absolute level of performance, if you were weak, relative to others, you got fired. Inside Enron, this practice was known as “rank-and-yank.” Skilling considered it one of the most important strategies his company had. But ultimately, it may have contributed to a work environment that rewarded deception and discouraged integrity. ([Location 489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=489))

- But another conclusion is that the focus on talent distracts us from something that is at least as important, and that is effort. In the next chapter, I’ll argue that, as much as talent counts, effort counts twice. ([Location 539](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=539))
- In other words, when we can’t easily see how experience and training got someone to a level of excellence that is so clearly beyond the norm, we default to labeling that person a “natural.” ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=568))
- “Yes, but the main thing is that greatness is doable. Greatness is many, many individual feats, and each of them is doable.” ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=580))
- that a high level of performance is, in fact, an accretion of mundane acts. ([Location 582](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=582))
- “With everything perfect,” Nietzsche wrote, “we do not ask how it came to be.” Instead, “we rejoice in the present fact as though it came out of the ground by magic.” ([Location 595](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=595))
- “No one can see in the work of the artist how it has become,” Nietzsche said. “That is its advantage, for wherever one can see the act of becoming one grows somewhat cool.” ([Location 597](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=597))
- We don’t want to sit on the pool deck and watch him progress from amateur to expert. We prefer our excellence fully formed. We prefer mystery to mundanity. ([Location 600](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=600))
- But why? What’s the reason for fooling ourselves into thinking Mark Spitz didn’t earn his mastery? “Our vanity, our self-love, promotes the cult of the genius,” Nietzsche said. “For if we think of genius as something magical, we are not obliged to compare ourselves and find ourselves lacking. . . . To call someone ‘divine’ means: ‘here there is no need to compete.’ ” ([Location 601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=601))
- So what is the reality of greatness? Nietzsche came to the same conclusion Dan Chambliss did. Great things are accomplished by those “people whose thinking is active in one direction, who employ everything as material, who always zealously observe their own inner life and that of others, who perceive everywhere models and incentives, who never tire of combining together the means available to them.” And what about talent? Nietzsche implored us to consider exemplars to be, above all else, craftsmen: “Do not talk about giftedness, inborn talents! One can name great men of all kinds who were very little gifted. They acquired greatness, became ‘geniuses’ (as we put it). . . . They all possessed that seriousness of the efficient workman which first learns to construct the parts properly before it ventures to fashion a great whole; they allowed themselves time for it, because they took more pleasure in making the little, secondary things well than in the effect of a dazzling whole.” ([Location 606](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=606))
- “Stop reading so much and go think.” ([Location 626](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=626))
- Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort. Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them. ([Location 638](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=638))
- By design, the Treadmill Test was exhausting. Not just physically but mentally. By measuring and then adjusting for baseline physical fitness, the researchers designed the Treadmill Test to gauge “stamina and strength of will.” In particular, Harvard researchers knew that running hard was not just a function of aerobic capacity and muscle strength but also the extent to which “a subject is willing to push himself or has a tendency to quit before the punishment becomes too severe.” ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=702))
- this finding merely indicated that physical health predicted later psychological well-being. ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=713))
- “Grit isn’t just working incredibly hard. That’s only part of it.” ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=778))
- “Right, it’s doing what you love, but not just falling in love—staying in love.” ([Location 783](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=783))
- What Jeff’s journey suggests instead is passion as a compass—that thing that takes you some time to build, tinker with, and finally get right, and that then guides you on your long and winding road to where, ultimately, you want to be. ([Location 908](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=908))
- what you’re trying to get out of life. In grit terms, he’s asking about your passion. ([Location 915](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=915))
- Pete’s philosophy is: Do things better than they have ever been done before. ([Location 916](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=916))

- One way to understand what Pete is talking about is to envision goals in a hierarchy. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=928))
- These low-level goals exist merely as means to ends. We want to accomplish them only because they get us something else we want. In contrast, the higher the goal in this hierarchy, the more abstract, general, and important it is. The higher the goal, the more it’s an end in itself, and the less it’s merely a means to an end. ([Location 932](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=932))
- If in the course of asking yourself these “Why?” questions your answer is simply “Just because!” then you know you’ve gotten to the top of a goal hierarchy. ([Location 938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=938))
- simple three-step process for prioritizing. The story goes like this: Buffett turns to his faithful pilot and says that he must have dreams greater than flying Buffett around to where he needs to go. The pilot confesses that, yes, he does. And then Buffett takes him through three steps. First, you write down a list of twenty-five career goals. Second, you do some soul-searching and circle the five highest-priority goals. Just five. Third, you take a good hard look at the twenty goals you didn’t circle. These you avoid at all costs. They’re what distract you; they eat away time and energy, taking your eye from the goals that matter more. ([Location 983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=983))
- the point of this exercise is to face the fact that time and energy are limited. Any successful person has to decide what to do in part by deciding what not to do. ([Location 1000](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1000))
- But I would also say that conventional prioritizing isn’t enough. When you have to divide your actions among a number of very different high-level career goals, you’re extremely conflicted. You need one internal compass—not two, three, four, or five. ([Location 1002](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1002))
- So, to Buffett’s three-step exercise in prioritizing, I would add an additional step: Ask yourself, To what extent do these goals serve a common purpose? ([Location 1006](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1006))
- what definitively set apart the eminent from the rest of humanity were a cluster of four indicators. Notably, these also distinguished the First Ten from the Last Ten—the super-eminent from the merely eminent. Cox grouped these together and called them “persistence of motive.” ([Location 1121](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1121))
- Two indicators could easily be rephrased as passion items for the Grit Scale. Degree to which he works with distant objects in view (as opposed to living from hand to mouth). Active preparation for later life. Working toward a definite goal. Tendency not to abandon tasks from mere changeability. Not seeking something fresh because of novelty. Not “looking for a change.” ([Location 1123](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1123))
- And the other two could easily be rewritten as perseverance items for the Grit Scale. Degree of strength of will or perseverance. Quiet determination to stick to a course once decided upon. Tendency not to abandon tasks in the face of obstacles. Perseverance, tenacity, doggedness. ([Location 1127](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1127))
- In her summary comments, Cox concluded that “high but not the highest intelligence, combined with the greatest degree of persistence, will achieve greater eminence than the highest degree of intelligence with somewhat less persistence.” ([Location 1131](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1131))
- I hasten to add that there isn’t just one gene that explains the heritability of grit. On the contrary, dozens of research studies have shown that almost all human traits are polygenic, meaning that traits are influenced by more than one gene. ([Location 1183](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1183))
- the Flynn effect refers to startling gains in IQ scores over the past century. ([Location 1195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1195))
- Flynn called this virtuous cycle of skill improvement the social multiplier effect, and he used the same logic to explain generational changes in abstract reasoning. ([Location 1216](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1216))
- Either small environmental differences, or genetic ones, can trigger a virtuous cycle. Either way, the effects are multiplied socially, through culture, because each of us enriches the environment of all of us. ([Location 1219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1219))
- I also learned that years of hard work are often mistaken for innate talent, and that passion is as necessary as perseverance to world-class excellence. ([Location 1250](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1250))
- Likewise, we learn, as novelist John Irving did, that “to do anything really well, you have to overextend yourself,” to appreciate that, “in doing something over and over again, something that was never natural becomes almost second nature,” ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1251))
- I’ll never forget picking Lucy up that afternoon. She smiled at me proudly and announced she’d used the potty. And then, in so many words, she told me she was done with diapers. And she was. Potty training happened in a single moment in time. How? Because when a child lines up for the potty with all the other children and sees that she’s expected to take her turn, she does exactly that. She learns to do what she needs to do. ([Location 1265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1265))
- It illustrates the maturity principle to a T. Noe’s family lives on campus, and as a teenager, his daughter was late to school almost every day. One summer, his daughter got a job folding clothes at the local American Eagle. On her first day, the store manager said, “Oh, by the way, the first time you’re late, you’re fired.” She was stunned. No second chances? All her life, there’d been patience, understanding, and second chances. ([Location 1269](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1269))
- First comes interest. Passion begins with intrinsically enjoying what you do. Every gritty person I’ve studied can point to aspects of their work they enjoy less than others, and most have to put up with at least one or two chores they don’t enjoy at all. Nevertheless, they’re captivated by the endeavor as a whole. With enduring fascination and childlike curiosity, they practically shout out, “I love what I do!” ([Location 1304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1304))
- Next comes the capacity to practice. One form of perseverance is the daily discipline of trying to do things better than we did yesterday. So, after you’ve discovered and developed interest in a particular area, you must devote yourself to the sort of focused, full-hearted, challenge-exceeding-skill practice that leads to mastery. You must zero in on your weaknesses, and you must do so over and over again, for hours a day, week after month after year. To be gritty is to resist complacency. “Whatever it takes, I want to improve!” is a refrain of all paragons of grit, no matter their particular interest, and no matter how excellent they already are. ([Location 1307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1307))
- Third is purpose. What ripens passion is the conviction that your work matters. For most people, interest without purpose is nearly impossible to sustain for a lifetime. It is therefore imperative that you identify your work as both personally interesting and, at the same time, integrally connected to the well-being of others. For a few, a sense of purpose dawns early, but for many, the motivation to serve others heightens after the development of interest and years of disciplined practice. Regardless, fully mature exemplars of grit invariably tell me, “My work is important—both to me and to others.” ([Location 1312](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1312))
- The four psychological assets of interest, practice, purpose, and hope are not You have it or you don’t commodities. ([Location 1325](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1325))
- “One thing that comes up time and time again is: ‘I love what I do.’ People couch it differently. Quite often, they say just that: ‘I love what I do.’ But they also say things like ‘I’m so lucky, I get up every morning looking forward to work, I can’t wait to get into the studio, I can’t wait to get on with the next project.’ These people are doing things not because they have to or because it’s financially lucrative. . . .” ([Location 1345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1345))
- passion for your work is a little bit of discovery, followed by a lot of development, and then a lifetime of deepening. ([Location 1458](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1458))
- As Jeff Bezos has observed, “One of the huge mistakes people make is that they try to force an interest on themselves.” Without experimenting, you can’t figure out which interests will stick, and which won’t. ([Location 1468](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1468))
- Finally, interests thrive when there is a crew of encouraging supporters, including parents, teachers, coaches, and peers. ([Location 1481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1481))
- “Just because you love something doesn’t mean you’ll be great,” says self-proclaimed Tiger Mom Amy Chua. ([Location 1500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1500))

- Longitudinal studies tracking learners confirm that overbearing parents and teachers erode intrinsic motivation. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1516))
- Kids whose parents let them make their own choices about what they like are more likely to develop interests later identified as a passion. ([Location 1516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1516))

- Fundamentally, the emotion of boredom, after doing something for a while, is a very natural reaction. All human beings, even from infancy, tend to look away from things they’ve already seen and, instead, turn their gaze to things that are new and surprising. ([Location 1590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1590))
- the word interest comes from the Latin interesse, which means “to differ.” ([Location 1591](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1591))
- “So, interest—the desire to learn new things, to explore the world, to seek novelty, to be on the lookout for change and variety—it’s a basic drive.” ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1609))
- Like me, Paul has found that experts often say things like “The more I know, the less I understand.” Sir John Templeton, for example, who pioneered the idea of diversified mutual funds, made the motto of his philanthropic foundation “How little we know, how eager to learn.” ([Location 1611](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1611))
- The key, Paul explained, is that novelty for the beginner comes in one form, and novelty for the expert in another. For the beginner, novelty is anything that hasn’t been encountered before. For the expert, novelty is nuance. ([Location 1613](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1613))
- Ask yourself a few simple questions: What do I like to think about? Where does my mind wander? What do I really care about? What matters most to me? How do I enjoy spending my time? And, in contrast, what do I find absolutely unbearable? If you find it hard to answer these questions, try recalling your teen years, the stage of life at which vocational interests commonly sprout. ([Location 1623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1623))

- Kaizen is Japanese for resisting the plateau of arrested development. Its literal translation is: “continuous improvement.” ([Location 1659](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1659))
- The really crucial insight of Ericsson’s research, though, is not that experts log more hours of practice. Rather, it’s that experts practice differently. Unlike most of us, experts are logging thousands upon thousands of hours of what Ericsson calls deliberate practice. ([Location 1687](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1687))
- Then experts do it all over again, and again, and again. Until they have finally mastered what they set out to do. Until what was a struggle before is now fluent and flawless. Until conscious incompetence becomes unconscious competence. ([Location 1725](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1725))
- Without hesitation, I can tell you the answer: YES. Even the most complex and creative of human abilities can be broken down into its component skills, each of which can be practiced, practiced, practiced. ([Location 1733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1733))
- firsthand description of what deliberate practice can feel like comes from dancer Martha Graham: “Dancing appears glamorous, easy, delightful. But the path to the paradise of that achievement is not easier than any other. There is fatigue so great that the body cries even in its sleep. There are times of complete frustration. There are daily small deaths.” ([Location 1787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1787))
- For instance, here’s how director Judd Apatow describes making a film: “Every day is an experiment. Every scene might not work and so you’re concentrating—Is it working? Should I get an extra line for editing? What would I change if I had to, if I hated this in three months, why would I hate it? And you’re concentrating and you’re exhausted. . . . It’s pretty intense.” ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1795))
- When I asked spelling champ Kerry Close if she’d ever experienced the state of flow during deliberate practice, she said, “No, the only time I could say that I was in flow was when I wasn’t being challenged.” ([Location 1931](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1931))
  - **Note:** You hve to be in less challenging case to get ton flow the only wy to get there is by deliberate practice and increse your skill level to be more than your regular dy job
- My guess is that deliberate practice can be deeply gratifying, but in a different way than flow. In other words, there are different kinds of positive experience: the thrill of getting better is one, and the ecstasy of performing at your best is another. ([Location 1935](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1935))
- performing at your best is another. ([Location 1936](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1936))
- First, know the science. Each of the basic requirements of deliberate practice is unremarkable: • A clearly defined stretch goal • Full concentration and effort • Immediate and informative feedback • Repetition with reflection and refinement ([Location 1938](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1938))
- We told them that trying to do things they can’t yet do, failing, and learning what they need to do differently is exactly the way experts practice. ([Location 1956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1956))
  - **Note:** What is practice
- My third suggestion for getting the most out of deliberate practice is to change the way you experience it. ([Location 1983](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=1983))

- Despite superficial differences in their upbringing and training, all the extraordinary people in Bloom’s study had progressed through three distinct periods of development. We discussed what Bloom called the “early years” in chapter 6 on interest and “the middle years” in chapter 7 on practice.

- Amy calls this idea “job crafting,” and it’s an intervention she’s been studying with fellow psychologists Jane Dutton, Justin Berg, and Adam Grant. This is not a Pollyanna, every-job-can-be-nirvana idea. It is, simply, the notion that whatever your occupation, you can maneuver within your job description—adding, delegating, and customizing what you do to match your interests and values. Amy and her collaborators recently tested this idea at Google. Employees working in positions that don’t immediately bring the word purpose to mind—in sales, marketing, finance, operations, and accounting, for example—were randomly assigned to a job-crafting workshop. They came up with their own ideas for tweaking their daily routines, each employee making a personalized “map” for what would constitute more meaningful and enjoyable work. Six weeks later, managers and coworkers rated the employees who attended this workshop as significantly happier and more effective.

- Let me wind back the clock to 1964. Two first-year psychology doctoral students named Marty Seligman and Steve Maier are in a windowless laboratory, watching a caged dog receive electric shocks to its back paws. The shocks come randomly and without warning. If the dog does nothing, the shock lasts five seconds, but if the dog pushes its nose against a panel at the front of the cage, the shock ends early. In a separate cage, another dog is receiving the same shocks at exactly the same intervals, but there’s no panel to push on. In other words, both dogs get the exact same dosage of shock at the exact same times, but only the first dog is in control of how long each shock lasts. After sixty-four shocks, both dogs go back to their home cages, and new dogs are brought in for the same procedure. The next day, one by one, all the dogs are placed in a different cage called a shuttle box. In the middle, there’s a low wall, just high enough that the dogs can leap the barrier if they try. A high-pitched tone plays, heralding an impending shock, which comes through the floor of the half of the shuttle box where the dog is standing. Nearly all the dogs who had control over the shocks the previous day learn to leap the barrier. They hear the tone and jump over the wall to safety. In contrast, two-thirds of the dogs who had no control over the shocks the previous day just lie down whimpering, passively waiting for the punishments to stop.

- When you keep searching for ways to change your situation for the better, you stand a chance of finding them. When you stop searching, assuming they can’t be found, you guarantee they won’t.

- To test her idea, Carol divided the children into two groups. Half the children were assigned to a success only program. For several weeks, they solved math problems and, at the end of each session, no matter how many they’d completed, they received praise for doing well. The other half of the children in Carol’s study were assigned to an attribution retraining program. These children also solved math problems, but were occasionally told that they hadn’t solved enough problems during that particular session and, crucially, that they “should have tried harder.” Afterward, all the children were given a combination of easy and very difficult problems to do. Carol reasoned that, if prior failures were the root cause of helplessness, the success only program would boost motivation. If, on the other hand, the real problem was how children interpreted their failures, then the attribution retraining program would be more effective. What Carol found is that the children in the success only program gave up just as easily after encountering very difficult problems as they had before training. In sharp contrast, children in the attribution retraining program tried harder after encountering difficulty. It seems as though they’d learned to interpret failure as a cue to try harder rather than as confirmation that they lacked the ability to succeed.

- Undermines Growth Mindset and Grit Promotes Growth Mindset and Grit “You’re a natural! I love that.” “You’re a learner! I love that.” “Well, at least you tried!” “That didn’t work.

Don’t feel bad if you can’t do it.” “This is hard. Don’t feel bad if you can’t do it yet.” “Maybe this just isn’t your strength.

- Similarly, Carol and her collaborators are finding that children develop more of a fixed mindset when their parents react to mistakes as though they’re harmful and problematic. This is true even when these parents say they have a growth mindset. Our children are watching us, and they’re imitating what we do. ([Location 2567](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2567))

- But we’re human. So, more often than we’d like, we get frustrated. We show our impatience. In judging the person’s abilities, we allow a flicker of doubt to distract us momentarily from the more important task of what they could do next to improve. ([Location 2581](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2581))

- The reality is that most people have an inner fixed-mindset pessimist in them right alongside their inner growth-mindset optimist. Recognizing this is important because it’s easy to make the mistake of changing what we say without changing our body language, facial expressions, and behavior. So what should we do? A good first step is to watch for mismatches between our words and actions. When we slip up—and we will—we can simply acknowledge that it’s hard to move away from a fixed, pessimistic view of the world. One of Carol’s colleagues, Susan Mackie, works with CEOs and encourages them to give names to their inner fixed-mindset characters. Then they can say things like “Oops. I guess I brought Controlling Claire to the meeting today. Let me try that again.” Or: “Overwhelmed Olivia is struggling to deal with all the competing demands, can you help me think this through?” 
- Ultimately, adopting a gritty perspective involves recognizing that people get better at things—they grow. Just as we want to cultivate the ability to get up off the floor when life has knocked us down, we want to give those around us the benefit of the doubt when something they’ve tried isn’t a raging success. There’s always tomorrow. ([Location 2583](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2583))

- “What doesn’t kill me makes me stronger,” Nietzsche once said. ([Location 2623](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2623))
- So, it appears that sometimes what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger, and sometimes it does the opposite. The urgent question becomes: When? When does struggle lead to hope, and when does struggle lead to hopelessness? A few years ago, Steve Maier and his students designed an experiment nearly identical to the one he and Marty Seligman had conducted forty years earlier: One group of rats received electric shocks, but if they turned a small wheel with their front paws, they could turn off the shock until the next trial. A second group received the exact same dose of electric shocks as the first but had no control over their duration. One crucial difference was that, in the new experiment, the rats were only five weeks old—that’s adolescence in the rat life cycle. A second difference was that the effects of this experience were assessed five weeks later, when the rats were fully mature adults. At that point, both groups of rats were subjected to uncontrollable electric shocks and, the next day, observed in a social exploration test. Here’s what Steve learned. Adolescent rats who experienced stress they could not control grew up to be adult rats who, after being subjected to uncontrollable shocks a second time, behaved timidly. This was not unusual—they learned to be helpless in the same way that any other rat would. In contrast, adolescent rats who experienced stress they could control grew up to be more adventurous and, most astounding, appeared to be inoculated against learned helplessness in adulthood. That’s right—when these “resilient rats” grew up, the usual uncontrollable shock procedures no longer made them helpless. In other words, what didn’t kill the young rats, when by their own efforts they could control what was happening, made them stronger for life.

- In his best-selling 1928 #parenting guide, Psychological Care of Infant and Child, Watson holds forth on how to raise a child “who loses himself in work and play, who quickly learns to overcome the small difficulties in his environment . . . and who finally enters manhood so bulwarked with stable work and emotional habits that no adversity can quite overwhelm him.” ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2757))

- But it’s a fine line between tough love and bullying, isn’t it? What’s the difference? “I knew the decision was mine,” Steve said. “And I knew my dad didn’t want me to be him. Number one, a parent needs to set a stage that proves to the child, ‘I’m not trying to just have you do what I say, control you, make you be like me, make you do what I did, ask you to make up for what I didn’t do.’ My dad showed me early that it wasn’t about him and what he needed. It truly was ‘I’m giving you all I got.’ “There was an underlying selflessness to the tough love,” Steve continued. “I think that’s vital. If any of the tough love is about the parent just trying to control you, well, kids smell it out. In every way possible, I knew my parents were saying, ‘We’re looking to see your success.

- First and foremost, there’s no either/or trade-off between supportive #parenting and demanding #parenting. It’s a common misunderstanding to think of “tough love” as a carefully struck balance between affection and respect on the one hand, and firmly enforced expectations on the other. In actuality, there’s no reason you can’t do both. Very clearly, this is exactly what the parents of Steve Young and Francesca Martinez did. The Youngs were tough, but they were also loving. The Martinezes were loving, but they were also tough. Both families were “child-centered” in the sense that they clearly put their children’s interests first, but neither family felt that children were always the better judge of what to do, how hard to work, and when to give up on things.

- Below is a figure representing how many psychologists now categorize #parenting styles. Instead of one continuum, there are two. In the upper right-hand quadrant are parents who are both demanding and supportive. The technical term is “authoritative #parenting,” which, unfortunately is easily confused with “authoritarian #parenting.” To avoid such confusion, I’ll refer to authoritative #parenting as wise #parenting, because parents in this quadrant are accurate judges of the psychological needs of their children. They appreciate that children need love, limits, and latitude to reach their full potential. Their authority is based on knowledge and wisdom, rather than power.

Supportive: Warm I can count on my parents to help me out if I have a problem. My parents spend time just talking to me. My parents and I do things that are fun together. My parents don’t really like me to tell them my troubles. My parents hardly ever praise me for doing well. Supportive: Respectful My parents believe I have a right to my own point of view. My parents tell me that their ideas are correct and that I shouldn’t question them. My parents respect my privacy. My parents give me a lot of freedom. My parents make most of the decisions about what I can do. Demanding My parents really expect me to follow family rules. My parents really let me get away with things.

- A young child’s instinct to copy adults is very strong. In a classic psychology experiment conducted more than fifty years ago at Stanford University, for example, preschoolers watched adults play with a variety of toys and then were given the opportunity to play with the toys themselves. Half of the boys and girls watched an adult quietly play with Tinkertoys while ignoring a child-size, inflatable doll in the same room. The other half of the children watched the adult begin assembling the Tinkertoys and, after a minute, turn to viciously attack the doll. The adult pummeled the doll with his fists and then a mallet, tossed the doll up in the air and, finally, while screaming and yelling, aggressively kicked the doll about the room. When given an opportunity to play with the same toys, children who’d seen adults play quietly followed suit. In contrast, children who’d watched adults beat up the doll were likewise aggressive, in many cases so closely imitating violent adults they’d seen earlier that researchers described their behavior as virtual “carbon copies.” And yet, there’s a world of difference between imitation and emulation. As we grow older, we develop the capacity to reflect on our actions and pass judgment on what we admire and disdain in others. When our parents are loving, respectful, and demanding, we not only follow their example, we revere it. We not only comply with their requests, we understand why they’re making them. We become especially eager to pursue the same interests—for instance, it’s no coincidence that Steve Young’s father was himself a standout football player at BYU, or that Francesca Martinez, like her father, developed an early love of writing. Benjamin Bloom and his team noted the same pattern in their studies of world-class performers. Almost without exception, the supportive and demanding parents in Bloom’s study were “models of the work ethic in that they were regarded as hard workers, they did their best in whatever they tried, they believed that work should come before play, and that one should work toward distant goals.” Further, “most of the parents found it natural to encourage their children to participate in their favored activities.” Indeed, one of Bloom’s summary conclusions was that “parents’ own interests somehow get communicated to the child. . . . We found over and over again that the parents of the pianists would send their child to the tennis lessons but they would take their child to the piano lessons. And we found just the opposite for the tennis homes.” ([Location 2968](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2968))
- It’s indeed remarkable how many paragons of grit have told me, with pride and awe, that their parents are their most admired and influential role models. And it’s just as telling that so many paragons have, in one way or another, developed very similar interests to those of their parents.

- If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to #parenting encourages your child to emulate you.

- It’s not just mothers and fathers who lay the foundation for grit. There’s a larger ecosystem of adults that extends beyond the nuclear family.

- Like a lot of parents, I had a strong intuition that grit is enhanced by doing activities like ballet . . . or piano . . . or football . . . or really any structured extracurricular activity. These activities possess two important features that are hard to replicate in any other setting. First, there’s an adult in charge—ideally, a supportive and demanding one—who is not the parent. Second, these pursuits are designed to cultivate interest, practice, purpose, and hope. The ballet studio, the recital hall, the dojo, the basketball court, the gridiron—these are the playing fields of grit. ([Location 3093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3093))
- The bottom line of this research is this: School’s hard, but for many kids it’s not intrinsically interesting. Texting your friends is interesting, but it’s not hard. But ballet? Ballet can be both. ([Location 3113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3113))
- Here’s an example: After a lackluster passing season his junior year of high school football, future NFL Hall of Famer Steve Young went down to the high school woodshop and fashioned a wooden football with tape for laces. In one end, he screwed in an eye hook and used that to latch the football to a weight machine in the high school gym. Then, gripping the ball, he’d move it back and forth in a passing motion, the added resistance developing his forearms and shoulders. His passing yardage doubled the next year.

- In a sense, the Personal Qualities Project was a horse race. Each of the hundred-plus measures at the start of the study could have ended up as the strongest predictor of later success. It’s clear from reading the first report, completed several years before the final data were collected, that Willingham was entirely dispassionate on the issue. He methodically described each variable, its rationale for being included, how it was measured, and so on. But when all the data were finally in, Willingham was unequivocal and emphatic about what he’d learned. One horse did win, and by a long stretch: follow-through. ([Location 3155](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3155))
- This is how Willingham and his team put a number on it: “The follow-through rating involved evidence of purposeful, continuous commitment to certain types of activities (in high school) versus sporadic efforts in diverse areas.” Students who earned a top follow-through rating participated in two different high school extracurricular activities for several years each and, in both of those activities, advanced significantly in some way (e.g., becoming editor of the newspaper, winning MVP for the volleyball team, winning a prize for artwork). As an example, Willingham described a student who was “on his school newspaper staff for three years and became managing editor, and was on the track team for three years and ended up winning an important meet.” ([Location 3160](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3160))
- Considered together, the evidence I’ve presented so far could be interpreted in two different ways. I’ve been arguing that extracurricular activities are a way for young people to practice, and therefore develop passion and perseverance, for long-term goals. But it’s also possible that following through with extracurriculars is something only gritty people do. These explanations aren’t mutually exclusive: it’s entirely possible that both factors—cultivation and selection—are at play. My best guess is that following through on our commitments while we grow up both requires grit and, at the same time, builds it. ([Location 3225](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3225))
- One reason I think so is that, in general, the situations to which people gravitate tend to enhance the very characteristics that brought us there in the first place. This theory of personality development has been dubbed the corresponsive principle by Brent Roberts, the foremost authority on what leads to enduring changes in how people think, feel, and act in different situations. When Brent was a psychology graduate student at Berkeley, the prevailing view was that, after childhood, personalities are more or less “set like plaster.” Brent and other personality researchers have since collected enough longitudinal data—following, literally, thousands of people across years and decades—to show that personalities do, in fact, change after childhood.

- For instance, in one study, Brent and his collaborators followed a thousand adolescents in New Zealand as they entered adulthood and found jobs. Over the years, hostile adolescents ended up in lower-prestige jobs and reported difficulties paying their bills. These conditions, in turn, led to increases in levels of hostility, which further eroded their employment prospects. By contrast, more agreeable adolescents entered a virtuous cycle of psychological development. These “nice… ([Location 3239](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3239))
- So far, there hasn’t been a corresponsive principle study of grit. Let me speculate, though. Left to her own devices, a little girl who, after failing to open a box of raisins and saying to herself, “This is too hard! I quit!” might enter a vicious cycle that reinforces giving up. She might learn to give up one thing after another, each time missing the opportunity to enter the virtuous cycle of struggle, followed by progress, followed by confidence to try something even harder. But what about a little girl whose mother takes her to ballet, even though it’s hard? Even though the little girl doesn’t really feel like putting on her leotard at that moment, because she’s a little tired. Even though, at the last practice, her ballet teacher scolded her for holding her arms the wrong way, which clearly stung a bit. What if that little girl was… ([Location 3243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3243))
- I pointed out that extracurricular follow-through might be a mere signal of grit, rather than something that would develop it. Bill agreed, but reaffirmed his judgment that activities aren’t just a signal. His intuition was that following through on hard things teaches a young person powerful, transferable lessons. “You’re learning from others, you’re finding out more and more through experience what your priorities are, you’re developing character. “In some cases,” Bill continued, “students get into activities because somebody else, maybe the parent, maybe the counselor, suggests it. But what often happens is that these experiences are actually transformative, and the students actually learn something very important, and then they jump in and contribute to these activities in ways that they and their parents and their counselor never would’ve imagined.” ([Location 3274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3274))

- Because his wife was a teacher, Bob had the opportunity to try short-term versions of the same experiments with children. For instance, in one study, he gave pennies to second and third graders for counting objects, memorizing pictures, and matching shapes. For some children, Bob rapidly increased the difficulty of these tasks as the children improved. Other children were repeatedly given easy versions of the same tasks. All the children got pennies and praise. Afterward, the children in both conditions were asked to do a tedious job that was entirely different from the previous tasks: copying a list of words onto a sheet of paper. Bob’s findings were exactly the same as what he’d found with rats: children who’d trained on difficult (rather than easy) tasks worked harder on the copying task.

- Indeed, I struggled to provide the sort of feedback I knew my children needed. I found myself enthusiastically praising them no matter what they did. And this is one of the reasons extracurricular activities offer superior playing fields for grit—coaches and teachers are tasked with bringing forth grit in children who are not their own. ([Location 3339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3339))
- In our family, we live by the Hard Thing Rule. It has three parts. The first is that everyone—including Mom and Dad—has to do a hard thing. A hard thing is something that requires daily deliberate practice. I’ve told my kids that psychological research is my hard thing, but I also practice yoga. Dad tries to get better and better at being a real estate developer; he does the same with running. My oldest daughter, Amanda, has chosen playing the piano as her hard thing. She did ballet for years, but later quit. So did Lucy. This brings me to the second part of the Hard Thing Rule: You can quit. But you can’t quit until the season is over, the tuition payment is up, or some other “natural” stopping point has arrived. You must, at least for the interval to which you’ve committed yourself, finish whatever you begin. In other words, you can’t quit on a day when your teacher yells at you, or you lose a race, or you have to miss a sleepover because of a recital the next morning. You can’t quit on a bad day. And, finally, the Hard Thing Rule states that you get to pick your hard thing. Nobody picks it for you because, after all, it would make no sense to do a hard thing you’re not even vaguely interested in. Even the decision to try ballet came after a discussion of various other classes my daughters could have chosen instead. ([Location 3350](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3350))
- At its core, a culture is defined by the shared norms and values of a group of people. In other words, a distinct culture exists anytime a group of people are in consensus about how we do things around here and why. As for how the rest of the world operates, the sharper the contrast, the stronger the bonds among those in what psychologists call the “in-group.” ([Location 3393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3393))
- When you adopt a culture, you make a categorical allegiance to that in-group. You’re not “sort of” a Seahawk, or “sort of” a West Pointer. You either are or you aren’t. You’re in the group, or out of it. You can use a noun, not just an adjective or a verb, to describe your commitment. So much depends, as it turns out, on which in-group you commit to. ([Location 3403](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3403))
- The bottom line on culture and grit is: If you want to be grittier, find a gritty culture and join it. If you’re a leader, and you want the people in your organization to be grittier, create a gritty culture. ([Location 3406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3406))

- “Look, when I started studying Olympians, I thought, ‘What kind of oddball gets up every day at four in the morning to go to swimming practice?’ I thought, ‘These must be extraordinary people to do that sort of thing.’ But the thing is, when you go to a place where basically everybody you know is getting up at four in the morning to go to practice, that’s just what you do. It’s no big deal. It becomes a habit.” ([Location 3422](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3422))
- “Speaking for myself,” Dan added, “I don’t have that much self-discipline. But if I’m surrounded by people who are writing articles and giving lectures and working hard, I tend to fall in line. If I’m in a crowd of people doing things a certain way, I follow along.” ([Location 3427](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3427))
- The drive to fit in—to conform to the group—is powerful indeed. Some of the most important psychology experiments in history have demonstrated how quickly, and usually without conscious awareness, the individual falls in line with a group that is acting or thinking a different way. ([Location 3429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3429))
- “So it seems to me,” Dan concluded, “that there’s a hard way to get grit and an easy way. The hard way is to do it by yourself. The easy way is to use conformity—the basic human drive to fit in—because if you’re around a lot of people who are gritty, you’re going to act grittier.” ([Location 3431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3431))
- What excites me most is the idea that, in the long run, culture has the power to shape our identity. Over time and under the right circumstances, the norms and values of the group to which we belong become our own. We internalize them. We carry them with us. The way we do things around here and why eventually becomes The way I do things and why. ([Location 3434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3434))
- Identity influences every aspect of our character, but it has special relevance to grit. Often, the critical gritty-or-not decisions we make—to get up one more time; to stick it out through this miserable, exhausting summer; to run five miles with our teammates when on our own we might only run three—are a matter of identity more than anything else. ([Location 3437](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3437))
- But other times, March says, we don’t think through the consequences of our actions at all. We don’t ask ourselves: What are the benefits? What are the costs? What are the risks? Instead, we ask ourselves: Who am I? What is this situation? What does someone like me do in a situation like this? ([Location 3446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3446))
- And that’s exactly why culture and identity are so critical to understanding how gritty people live their lives. The logic of anticipated costs and benefits doesn’t explain their choices very well. The logic of identity does. ([Location 3471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3471))
- The Finns have something they call sisu. It is a compound of bravado and bravery, of ferocity and tenacity, of the ability to keep fighting after most people would have quit, and to fight with the will to win. The Finns translate sisu as “the Finnish spirit” but it is a much more gutful word than that. ([Location 3484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3484))
- there are two powerful lessons we can take from sisu. First, thinking of yourself as someone who is able to overcome tremendous adversity often leads to behavior that confirms that self-conception. If you’re a Finn with that “sisu spirit,” you get up again no matter what. Likewise, if you’re a Seattle Seahawk, you’re a competitor. You have what it takes to succeed. You don’t let setbacks hold you back. Grit is who you are. Second, even if the idea of an actual inner energy source is preposterous, the metaphor couldn’t be more apt. It sometimes feels like we have nothing left to give, and yet, in those dark and desperate moments, we find that if we just keep putting one foot in front of the other, there is a way to accomplish what all reason seems to argue against.

- Jamie has a favorite Teddy Roosevelt quote he likes to repeat: It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

- And here is how Jamie translates the poetry of Roosevelt into the prose of a JPMorgan Chase manual, titled How We Do Business: “Have a fierce resolve in everything you do.” “Demonstrate determination, resiliency, and tenacity.” “Do not let temporary setbacks become permanent excuses.” And, finally, “Use mistakes and problems as opportunities to get better—not reasons to quit.” ([Location 3537](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3537))

These words, first spoken in an 1879 address to the cadets by then superintendent John Schofield, are the sort you’d expect a West Pointer to know by heart.

My experience is that once you have done the work to create the clear vision, it is the discipline and effort to maintain that vision that can make it all come true. The two go hand in hand. The moment you’ve created that vision, you’re on your way, but it’s the diligence with which you stick to that vision that allows you to get there. Getting that across to players is a constant occupation. ([Location 3645](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3645))

It’s really the guy across from us that makes us who we are.” Our opponent, Pete explained, creates challenges that help us become our best selves.

Compete means excellence. “Compete comes from the Latin,” explains Mike Gervais, the competitive-surfer-turned-sports-psychologist who is one of Pete’s partners in culture building. “Quite literally, it means strive together.
