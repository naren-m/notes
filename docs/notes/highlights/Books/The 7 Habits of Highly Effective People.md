### Highlights

- “There is no real excellence in all this world which can be separated from right living.” DAVID STARR JORDAN ([Location 63](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01069X4H0&location=63))
- became particularly interested in how perceptions are formed, how they govern the way we see, and how the way we see governs how we behave. This led me to a study of expectancy theory and self-fulfilling prophecies or the “Pygmalion effect,” and to a realization of how deeply imbedded our perceptions are. It taught me that we must look at the lens through which we see the world, as well as at the world we see, and that the lens itself shapes how we interpret the world.
