A #memoir of #leadership and #success

### Highlights

- When the unexpected does happen, a kind of instinctive triage kicks in. You have to rely on your own internal “threat scale.” ([Location 110](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=110))
- Sometimes, even though you’re “in charge,” you need to be aware that in the moment you might have nothing to add, and so you don’t wade in. You trust your people to do their jobs and focus your energies on some other pressing issue. ([Location 113](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=113))




- Optimism. One of the most important qualities of a good leader is optimism, a pragmatic enthusiasm for what can be achieved. Even in the face of difficult choices and less than ideal outcomes, an optimistic leader does not yield to pessimism. Simply put, people are not motivated or energized by pessimists. ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=251))

- Courage.
  - The foundation of risk-taking is courage, and in ever-changing, disrupted businesses, risk-taking is essential, innovation is vital, and true innovation occurs only when people have courage. This is true of acquisitions, investments, and capital allocations, and it particularly applies to creative decisions. Fear of failure destroys creativity.
- Focus.
  - Allocating time, energy, and resources to the strategies, problems, and projects that are of highest importance and value is extremely important, and it’s imperative to communicate your priorities clearly and often.
- Decisiveness.
  - All decisions, no matter how difficult, can and should be made in a timely way. Leaders must encourage a diversity of opinion balanced with the need to make and implement decisions. Chronic indecision is not only inefficient and counterproductive, but it is deeply corrosive to morale.
- Curiosity.
  - A deep and abiding curiosity enables the discovery of new people, places, and ideas, as well as an awareness and an understanding of the marketplace and its changing dynamics. The path to innovation begins with curiosity.
- Fairness. Strong leadership embodies the fair and decent treatment of people. Empathy is essential, as is accessibility. People committing honest mistakes deserve second chances, and judging people too harshly generates fear and anxiety, which discourage communication and innovation. Nothing is worse to an organization than a culture of fear. Thoughtfulness. Thoughtfulness is one of the most underrated elements of good leadership. It is the process of gaining knowledge, so an opinion rendered or decision made is more credible and more likely to be correct. It’s simply about taking the time to develop informed opinions.
- Authenticity. Be genuine. Be honest. Don’t fake anything. Truth and authenticity breed respect and trust. The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection. This doesn’t mean perfectionism at all costs, but it does mean a refusal to accept mediocrity or make excuses for something being “good enough.” If you believe that something can be made better, put in the effort to do it. If you’re in the business of making things, be in the business of making things great.
- Integrity. Nothing is more important than the quality and integrity of an organization’s people and its product. A company’s success depends on setting high ethical standards for all things, big and small. Another way of saying this is: The way you do anything is the way you do everything. ([Location 253](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=253))
- Innovate or die, and there’s no innovation if you operate out of fear of the new or untested. ([Location 476](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=476))
- He wasn’t a yeller, but he was tough and exacting and he communicated in very clear terms what was wrong and that he expected it to get fixed, and he didn’t much care what sacrifice it required to fix it. ([Location 485](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=485))
  - **Note:** Roone
- His mantra was simple: “Do what you need to do to make it better.” Of all the things I learned from Roone, this is what shaped me the most. ([Location 491](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=491))
- “the relentless pursuit of perfection.” ([Location 492](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=492))
- It’s not, at least as I have internalized it, about perfectionism at all costs (something Roone wasn’t especially concerned about). Instead, it’s about creating an environment in which you refuse to accept mediocrity. ([Location 493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=493))
- He is described by some as being the living embodiment of the Japanese word shokunin, which is “the endless pursuit of perfection for some greater good.” I fell in love with Jiro when I watched it and became fascinated by the concept of shokunin. ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=500))
- It’s a delicate thing, finding the balance between demanding that your people perform and not instilling a fear of failure in them. ([Location 533](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=533))
- Excellence and fairness don’t have to be mutually exclusive. ([Location 571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=571))
- and, crucially, he knew what he didn’t know. This is a rare trait in a boss. ([Location 647](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=647))
- I learned from them that genuine decency and professional competitiveness weren’t mutually exclusive. ([Location 657](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=657))

- In fact, true integrity—a sense of knowing who you are and being guided by your own clear sense of right and wrong—is a kind of secret weapon. ([Location 658](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=658))
- Your inexperience can’t be an excuse for failure. So what do you do in a situation like that? The first rule is not to fake anything. You have to be humble, and you can’t pretend to be someone you’re not or to know something you don’t. You’re also in a position of leadership, though, so you can’t let humility prevent you from leading. It’s a fine line, and something I preach today. ([Location 773](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=773))
- True authority and true leadership come from knowing who you are and not pretending to be anything else. ([Location 778](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=778))

- Empathy is a prerequisite to the sound management of creativity, and respect is critical. ([Location 888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=888))
- But there’s a way to convey that while also conveying that you trust the people who work for you, and preserving in them an entrepreneurial spirit. Dan Burke taught me that exact lesson early on in a way that couldn’t have been more opposite from the Strat Planning approach. I can’t recall exactly what it was in response to, but in one of our conversations about some initiative I was considering, Dan handed me a note that read: “Avoid getting into the business of manufacturing trombone oil. You may become the greatest trombone-oil manufacturer in the world, but in the end, the world only consumes a few quarts of trombone oil a year!” He was telling me not to invest in projects that would sap the resources of my company and me and not give much back. It was such a positive way to impart that wisdom, ([Location 1157](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1157))

- Managing your own time and respecting others’ time is one of the most vital things to do as a manager, and he was horrendous at it. ([Location 1194](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1194))
- You have to learn and absorb. You have to hear out other people’s problems and help find solutions. ([Location 1201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1201))
- It’s a hard thing to do, especially in the moment, but those instances in which you find yourself hoping that something will work without being able to convincingly explain to yourself how it will work—that’s when a little bell should go off, and you should walk yourself through some clarifying questions. What’s the problem I need to solve? Does this solution make sense? If I’m feeling some doubt, why? Am I doing this for sound reasons or am I motivated by something personal? ([Location 1222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1222))
- I’ve been asked a lot over the years about the best way to nurture ambition—both one’s own and that of the people you manage. As a leader, you should want those around you to be eager to rise up and take on more responsibility, as long as dreaming about the job they want doesn’t distract them from the job they have. ([Location 1237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1237))

- It’s important to know how to find the balance—do the job you have well; be patient; look for opportunities to pitch in and expand and grow; and make yourself one of the people, through attitude and energy and focus, that your bosses feel they have to turn to when an opportunity arises. ([Location 1242](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1242))
- The dynamics between a CEO and the next person in line for his or her job are often fraught, though. We all want to believe we’re irreplaceable. The trick is to be self-aware enough that you don’t cling to the notion that you are the only person who can do this job. At its essence, good leadership isn’t about being indispensable; it’s about helping others be prepared to possibly step into your shoes—giving them access to your own decision making, identifying the skills they need to develop and helping them improve, and, as I’ve had to do, sometimes being honest with them about why they’re not ready for the next step up. ([Location 1249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1249))
- Thanks to my years working for Roone Arledge, I didn’t need to be convinced that the success or failure of something so often comes down to the details. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1471))
- He understood that “great” is often a collection of very small things, ([Location 1474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1474))
- It’s about believing you and the people around you can steer toward the best outcome, and not communicating the feeling that all is lost if things don’t break your way. ([Location 1545](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1545))

- A company’s culture is shaped by a lot of things, but this is one of the most important—you have to convey your priorities clearly and repeatedly. In my experience, it’s what separates great managers from the rest. ([Location 1754](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1754))
- If leaders don’t articulate their priorities clearly, then the people around them don’t know what their own priorities should be. ([Location 1755](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1755))
- You can do a lot for the morale of the people around you (and therefore the people around them) just by taking the guesswork out of their day-to-day life. ([Location 1758](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1758))
- A CEO must provide the company and its senior team with a road map. A lot of work is complex and requires intense amounts of focus and energy, but this kind of messaging is fairly simple: This is where we want to be. This is how we’re going to get there. Once those things are laid out simply, so many decisions become easier to make, and the overall anxiety of an entire organization is lowered. ([Location 1759](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1759))
- “But my goal is for Disney to be the most admired company in the world, by our consumers and our shareholders and by our employees. That last part is key. We’ll never get the admiration or the public unless we get it from our own people first. And the way to get the people working for us to admire the company and believe in its future is to make products they’re proud of. It’s that simple.” ([Location 1795](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1795))
- When I look back on that time now, I think of it as a hard-earned lesson about the importance of tenacity and perseverance, but also about the need to steer clear of anger and anxiety over things you can’t control. ([Location 1884](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1884))
- It’s easy to be optimistic when everyone is telling you you’re great. It’s much harder, and much more necessary, when your sense of yourself is being challenged, and in such a public way. ([Location 1887](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=1887))
- I even took a moment before I walked into the room to look again at Theodore Roosevelt’s “The Man in the Arena” speech, which has long been an inspiration: “It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood.” ([Location 2419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=2419))
- “I’ve asked you to come in here for a difficult reason.” And then I try to be as direct about the issue as possible, explaining clearly and concisely what wasn’t working and why I didn’t think it was going to change. I emphasize that it was a tough decision to make, and that I understand that it’s much harder on them. ([Location 2691](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=2691))
- I told him I understood. Four and a half years earlier, I’d sat with George at breakfast and tried to convey that I knew how difficult this would be for him, but that when he was ready, he could trust me. All of the negotiations—over the money, and then over the question of his ongoing involvement with Star Wars—were exercises in balancing my respect for what George had done, and how deeply personal I knew this was for him, with my responsibility to the company. I could empathize with George, but I couldn’t give him what he wanted. At every step of the way it was necessary to be clear about where I stood, while being sensitive toward how emotional the entire process was for him. ([Location 3024](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=3024))
- I knew the board would demand solutions, and, as a general rule, I don’t like to lay out problems without offering a plan for addressing them. (This is something I exhort my team to do, too—it’s okay to come to me with problems, but also offer possible solutions.) So ([Location 3082](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=3082))
- company. With a company the size of Disney, this can mean traveling around the world and holding regular town hall–style meetings with our various business units, communicating my thinking and responding to concerns, but it also means responding in a timely way and being thoughtful about any issues brought to me by my direct reports—returning phone calls and replying to emails, making the time to talk through specific problems, being sensitive to the pressures people are feeling. All of this became an even more significant part of the job as we embarked on this new, uncertain path. ([Location 3119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=3119))
- one place. Some are concrete and prescriptive; some a bit more philosophical. When I read through these bits and pieces of collected wisdom, they are a kind of map to the last forty-five years: This is what I was taught every day by this person, and this is what I learned from that one. Here is the thing that I didn’t understand then but do now, that could only come with experience. My hope is that these ideas, and the stories I’ve told throughout this book to give them some context, might feel relatable to you, too. They are the lessons that shaped my professional life, and I hope they are useful for yours. To tell great stories, you need great talent. Now more than ever: innovate or die. There can be no innovation if you operate out of fear of the new. I talk a lot about “the relentless pursuit of perfection.” In practice, this can mean a lot of things, and it’s hard to define. It’s a mindset, more than a specific set of rules. It’s not about perfectionism at all costs. It’s about creating an environment in which people refuse to accept mediocrity. It’s about pushing back against the urge to say that “good enough” is good enough. Take responsibility when you screw up. In work, in life, you’ll be more respected and trusted by the people around you if you own up to your mistakes. It’s impossible to avoid them; but it is possible to acknowledge them, learn from them, and set an example that it’s okay to get things wrong sometimes. Be decent to people. Treat everyone with fairness and empathy. This doesn’t mean that you lower your expectations or convey the message that mistakes don’t matter. It means that you create an environment where people know you’ll hear them out, that you’re emotionally consistent and fair-minded, and that they’ll be given second chances for honest mistakes. Excellence and fairness don’t have to be mutually exclusive. Strive for perfection but always be aware of the pitfalls of caring only about the product and never the people. True integrity—a sense of knowing who you are and being guided by your own clear sense of right and wrong—is a kind of secret leadership weapon. If you trust your own instincts and treat people with respect, the company will come to represent the values you live by. Value ability more than experience, and put people in roles that require more of them than they know they have in them. Ask the questions you need to ask, admit without apology what you don’t understand, and do the work to learn what you need to learn as quickly as you can. Managing creativity is an art, not a science. When giving notes, be mindful of how much of themselves the person you’re speaking to has poured into the project and how much is at stake for them. Don’t start negatively, and don’t start small. People will often focus on little details as a way of masking a lack of any clear, coherent, big thoughts. If you start petty, you seem petty. Of all the lessons I learned in my first year running prime time at ABC, the… ([Location 3571](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B07PF6XTD8&location=3571))
