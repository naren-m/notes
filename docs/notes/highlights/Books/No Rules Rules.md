### Highlights

- The second is that the market shifted from C++ to Java. To survive, we needed to change. But we had selected and conditioned our employees to follow process, not to think freshly or shift fast. We were unable to adapt and, in 1997, ended up selling the company to our largest competitor. ([Location 191](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=191))
- If you give employees more freedom instead of developing processes to prevent them from exercising their own judgment, they will make better decisions and it’s easier to hold them accountable. This also makes for a happier, more motivated workforce as well as a more nimble company. ([Location 196](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=196))
- But to develop a foundation that enables this level of freedom you need to first increase two other elements: + Build up talent density. At most companies, policies and control processes are put in place to deal with employees who exhibit sloppy, unprofessional, or irresponsible behavior. But if you avoid or move out these people, you don’t need the rules. If you build an organization made up of high performers, you can eliminate most controls. The denser the talent, the greater the freedom you can offer. + Increase candor. Talented employees have an enormous amount to learn from one another. But the normal polite human protocols often prevent employees from providing the feedback necessary to take performance to another level. When talented staff members get into the feedback habit, they all get better at what they do while becoming implicitly accountable to one another, further reducing the need for traditional controls. ([Location 198](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=198))
- Later, as talent becomes increasingly denser and feedback more frequent and candid, you can remove approval processes throughout the organization, teaching your managers principles like, “Lead with context, not control,” and coaching your employees using such guidelines as, “Don’t seek to please your boss.” ([Location 210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=210))
- Removing controls creates a culture of “Freedom and Responsibility” (a term Netflix employees use so much that they now just say “F&R”), which attracts top talent and makes possible even fewer controls. ([Location 213](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=213))
- Stanford University, Steve Jobs said: “You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something—your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.” ([Location 251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=251))
- Sir Richard Branson’s mantra is said to be “A-B-C-D,” or “Always be connecting the dots.” And David Brier and Fast Company released a fascinating video that claims the way we connect life’s dots defines how we see reality, and thus how we make decisions and reach conclusions. ([Location 254](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=254))
- Blockbuster made most of its margin from late fees. If your business model depends on inducing feelings of stupidity in your customer base, you can hardly expect to build much loyalty. ([Location 287](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=287))
- Those who were exceptionally creative, did great work, and collaborated well with others went immediately into the “keepers” pile. ([Location 307](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=307))
- Patty was saying. I asked her to tell me her HR philosophy, and she said: “I believe that every individual should be able to draw a line between their contribution to the corporation and their individual aspirations. As the head of human capital management, I would work with you, the CEO, to increase the emotional intelligence quotient of our leadership and improve employee engagement.” ([Location 335](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=335))
- In hindsight, I understood that a team with one or two merely adequate performers brings down the performance of everyone on the team. ([Location 357](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=357))
- If you have a team of five stunning employees and two adequate ones, the adequate ones will sap managers’ energy, so they have less time for the top performers, reduce the quality of group discussions, lowering the team’s overall IQ, force others to develop ways to work around them, reducing efficiency, drive staff who seek excellence to quit, and show the team you accept mediocrity, thus multiplying the problem. ([Location 358](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=358))
- A fast and innovative workplace is made up of what we call “stunning colleagues”—highly talented people, of diverse backgrounds and perspectives, who are exceptionally creative, accomplish significant amounts of important work, and collaborate effectively. ([Location 405](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=405))
- Your number one goal as a leader is to develop a work environment consisting exclusively of stunning colleagues. ([Location 410](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=410))
- Stunning colleagues accomplish significant amounts of important work and are exceptionally creative and passionate. ([Location 411](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=411))
- Jerks, slackers, sweet people with nonstellar performance, or pessimists left on the team will bring down the performance of everyone. ([Location 412](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=412))
- I didn’t want to upset anyone, so I avoided any difficult topics. I didn’t have many role models for constructive candor, and it took me a long time to get comfortable with it. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=425))
- I modeled this behavior as best I could, and whenever someone came to me to complain about another employee, I would ask, “What did that person say when you spoke to him about this directly?” ([Location 462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=462))
- HIGH PERFORMANCE + SELFLESS CANDOR = EXTREMELY HIGH PERFORMANCE ([Location 490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=490))
- Ted clearly demonstrated the two behavioral necessities to get employees to give the boss candid feedback. Don’t just ask for feedback but tell and show your employees it is expected ([Location 637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=637))
- AIM TO ASSIST: Feedback must be given with positive intent. Giving feedback in order to get frustration off your chest, intentionally hurting the other person, or furthering your political agenda is not tolerated. Clearly explain how a specific behavior change will help the individual or the company, not how it will help you. “The way you pick your teeth in meetings with external partners is irritating” is wrong feedback. Right feedback would be, “If you stop picking your teeth in external partner meetings, the partners are more likely to see you as professional, and we’re more likely to build a strong relationship.” ([Location 696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=696))
- ACTIONABLE: Your feedback must focus on what the recipient can do differently. Wrong feedback to me in Cuba would have been to stop at the comment, “Your presentation is undermining its own messages.” Right feedback was, “The way you ask the audience for input is resulting in only Americans participating.” Even better would have been: “If you can find a way to solicit contributions from other nationalities in the room your presentation will be more powerful.” ([Location 701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=701))
- APPRECIATE: Natural human inclination is to provide a defense or excuse when receiving criticism; we all reflexively seek to protect our egos and reputation. When you receive feedback, you need to fight this natural reaction and instead ask yourself, “How can I show appreciation for this feedback by listening carefully, considering the message with an open mind, and becoming neither defensive nor angry?” ACCEPT OR DISCARD: You will receive lots of feedback from lots of people while at Netflix. You are required to listen and consider all feedback provided. You are not required to follow it. Say “thank you” with sincerity. But both you and the provider must understand that the decision to react to the feedback is entirely up to the recipient. ([Location 706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=706))
- With candor, high performers become outstanding performers. Frequent candid feedback exponentially magnifies the speed and effectiveness of your team or workforce. ([Location 798](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=798))
- Coach your employees to give and receive feedback effectively, following the 4A guidelines. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=801))
- As the leader, solicit feedback frequently and respond with belonging cues when you receive it. ([Location 802](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=802))
- Leslie Kilgore coined the expression “Lead with context, not control” ([Location 956](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=956))
- Freedom is not the opposite of accountability, as I’d previously considered. Instead, it is a path toward it. ([Location 1034](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1034))
- But, as an engineer, I was familiar with a concept that has been understood in software since 1968, referred to as the “rock-star principle.” The rock-star principle is rooted in a famous study that took place in a basement in Santa Monica. At 6:30 a.m. nine trainee programmers were led into a room with dozens of computers. Each of them was handed a manila envelope explaining a series of coding and debugging tasks they would need to complete to their best ability in the next 120 minutes. Millions of keystrokes have since been devoted to discussing the results on the internet. The researchers expected to find that the best of the nine programmers would outperform his average counterpart by a factor of two or three. But of the group of nine, all of whom were at least adequate programmers, the best far outperformed the worst. The best guy was twenty times faster at coding, twenty-five times faster at debugging, and ten times faster at program execution than the programmer with the lowest marks. The fact that one of these programmers would so dramatically outperform another has caused ripples across the software industry ever since, as managers grapple with how some programmers can be worth so much more than their perfectly adequate colleagues. With a fixed amount of money for salaries and a project I needed to complete, I had a choice. I could hire ten to twenty-five average engineers or I could hire one “rock-star” and pay significantly more than what I’d pay the others, if necessary. ([Location 1362](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1362))
- Since then I have come to see that the best programmer doesn’t add ten times the value. She adds more like a hundred times. ([Location 1373](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1373))
- “A great lathe operator commands several times the wages of an average lathe operator, but a great writer of software code is worth ten thousand times the price of an average software writer.” ([Location 1375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1375))
- The great software engineer is incredibly creative and can see conceptual patterns that others can’t. She has an adjustable perspective, so when she gets stuck in a specific way of thinking, she has ways to push, pull, or prod herself to look beyond. These ([Location 1378](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1378))
- If you work for a small, unknown company, and hope to apply Reed’s theory, you’ll probably find the person you need. ([Location 1406](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1406))
- We did this first study in India, where the cost of living is low, so we could pay people amounts substantial to them but within our budget. The lowest bonus was 50 cents—equivalent to what participants could receive for a day’s work. The highest bonus was $50, five months’ pay. The results were unexpected. The people offered medium bonuses performed no better, or worse, than those offered low bonuses. But what was most interesting was that the group offered the biggest bonus did worse than the other two groups across all the tasks. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1455))
- We replicated these results in a study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where undergraduate students were offered the chance to earn a high bonus ($600) or a lower one ($60) by performing one task that called for some cognitive skill (adding numbers) and another one that required only a mechanical skill (tapping a key as fast as possible). We found that as long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance. But when we included a task that required even rudimentary cognitive skill, the outcome was the same as in the India study: the offer of a higher bonus led to poorer performance. ([Location 1459](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1459))
- Creative work requires that your mind feel a level of freedom. If part of what you focus on is whether or not your performance will get you that big check, you are not in that open cognitive space where the best ideas and most innovative possibilities reside. You do worse. ([Location 1465](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1465))
- Big salaries, not merit bonuses, are good for innovation. ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1469))
- the book Negotiating Your Salary: How to Make $1000 a Minute by Jack Chapman recommends the best way to get a good deal with a new employer: HIRING MANAGER: We’ve squeezed our budget and found we can offer you a salary of $95,000 a year! We’re excited and hope you are too! YOU: (Stay silent. Sing a song in your head. Count the spots on the rug. Roll your tongue over your braces.) HIRING MANAGER: (now nervous) We may be able to go up to $110,000 however. That will be a big stretch but we hope you will accept. YOU: (continue to sing silently to yourself) Netflix, ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1498))
- when it comes to review time, instead of looking at what that employee is worth on the market, most companies use “raise pools” and “salary bands” to determine raises. Imagine that Santa has eight elves each currently paid $50,000, and every year on December 26 he increases their salaries. He and Mrs. Claus put aside a big pot of money for raises, let’s say 3 percent of total salary costs (between 2 percent and 5 percent is standard for American companies). Three percent of $400,000 = $12,000. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1543))
- Rites of Passage at $100,000 to $1 Million+, which back in the eighties and nineties was the handbook for executive recruiters. It tells you how to know your market value and how to talk to recruiters to get that data. I say to all my people, “Understand your market, understand the book, go and meet these recruiters—and ([Location 1649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=1649))
- whisper wins and shout mistakes ([Location 2050](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2050))
- But the Pure board didn’t accept it. Financially, the company was doing well. They agreed that I’d made mistakes with people management but claimed that, if they hired someone new, that person would make mistakes also. Two fascinating things happened during that meeting. One was that, as expected, I felt immense relief because I had told the truth and come clean about my errors. The other was more interesting: the board seemed to believe in my leadership more after I had opened up and made myself vulnerable to them. ([Location 2057](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2057))
- I quickly came to see the biggest advantage of sunshining a leader’s errors is to encourage everyone to think of making mistakes as normal. This in turn encourages employees to take risks when success is uncertain . . . which leads to greater innovation across the company. Self-disclosure builds trust, seeking help boosts learning, admitting mistakes fosters forgiveness, and broadcasting failures encourages your people to act courageously.

- Humility is important in a leader and role model. ([Location 2072](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2072))
- When you succeed, speak about it softly or let others mention it for you. But when you make a mistake say it clearly and loudly, so that everyone can learn and profit from your errors. In other words, “Whisper wins and shout mistakes.” ([Location 2073](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B081Y3R657&location=2073))
- Elliot Aronson ran an experiment. He asked students to listen to recordings of candidates interviewing to be part of a quiz-bowl team. Two of the candidates showed how smart they were by answering most of the questions correctly, while the other two answered only 30 percent right. Then, one group of students heard an explosion of clanging dishes, followed by one of the smart candidates saying, “Oh my goodness—I’ve spilled coffee all over my new suit.” Another group of students heard the same clamor, but then heard one of the mediocre candidates saying he spilled the coffee. Afterward, the students said they liked the smart candidate even more after he embarrassed himself. But the opposite was true of the mediocre candidate. The students said they liked him even less after seeing him in a vulnerable situation. This tendency has a name: the pratfall effect. The pratfall effect is the tendency for someone’s appeal to increase or decrease after making a mistake, depending on his or her perceived ability to perform well in general.
