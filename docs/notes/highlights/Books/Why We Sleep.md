- Dreaming provides a unique suite of benefits to all species fortunate enough to experience it, humans included. Among these gifts are a consoling neurochemical bath that mollifies painful memories and a virtual reality space in which the brain melds past and present knowledge, inspiring creativity. Downstairs in the body, sleep restocks the armory of our immune system, helping fight malignancy, preventing infection, and warding off all manner of sickness. Sleep reforms the body’s metabolic state by fine-tuning the balance of insulin and circulating glucose.

- I should point out that you need not read this book in this progressive, four-part narrative arc. Each chapter can, for the most part, be read individually, and out of order, without losing too much of its significance. I therefore invite you to consume the book in whole or in part, buffet-style or in order, all according to your personal

- powerful sculpting force of your twenty-four-hour rhythm, also known as your s[[circadian rhythm]]. Everyone generates a [[circadian rhythm]] (circa, meaning “around,” and dian, derivative of diam, meaning “day”).

- Any signal that the brain uses for the purpose of clock resetting is termed a zeitgeber, from the German “time giver” or “synchronizer.” Thus,
  - ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=274))
- The twenty-four-hour biological clock sitting in the middle of your brain is called the suprachiasmatic (pronounced soo-pra-kai-as-MAT-ik) nucleus.

- instructional: supra, meaning above, and chiasm, meaning a crossing point.

- not everyone’s circadian timing is the same.
  - ([Location 302](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=302))
- Melatonin acts like a powerful bullhorn, shouting out a clear message to the brain and body: “It’s dark, it’s dark!”
  - ([Location 343](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=343))
- melatonin helps regulate the timing of when sleep occurs by systemically signaling darkness throughout the organism. But melatonin has little influence on the generation of sleep itself: a mistaken assumption that many people hold.
  - ([Location 345](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=345))
- To make clear this distinction, think of sleep as the Olympic 100-meter race. Melatonin is the voice of the timing official that says “Runners, on your mark,” and then fires the starting pistol that triggers the race. That timing official (melatonin) governs when the race (sleep) begins, but does not participate in the race.
  - ([Location 347](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=347))
- Melatonin simply provides the official instruction to commence the event of sleep, but does not participate in the sleep race itself.
  - ([Location 351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=351))
- every day you are in a different time zone, your suprachiasmatic nucleus can only readjust by about one hour.
  - ([Location 383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=383))
- Caffeine has an average half-life of five to seven hours. Let’s say that you have a cup of coffee after your evening dinner, around 7:30 p.m. This means that by 1:30 a.m., 50 percent of that caffeine may still be active and circulating throughout your brain tissue. In other words, by 1:30 a.m., you’re only halfway to completing the job of cleansing your brain of the caffeine you drank after dinner.
  - ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=431))
- the longer you are awake, the more adenosine builds up, creating an increasing urge (pressure) to sleep.
  - ([Location 481](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=481))
- First, after waking up in the morning, could you fall back asleep at ten or eleven a.m.? If the answer is “yes,” you are likely not getting sufficient sleep quantity and/or quality. Second, can you function optimally without caffeine before noon? If the answer is “no,” then you are most likely self-medicating your state of chronic sleep deprivation.
  - ([Location 536](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=536))
  - **Note:** Getting enough sleep?
- All these signals still flood into the center of your brain, but it is here, in the sensory convergence zone, where that journey ends while you sleep. The signals are blocked by a perceptual barricade set up in a structure called the thalamus (THAL-uh-muhs).

- That is, memories were being “replayed” at the level of brain-cell activity as the rats snoozed.
  - ([Location 640](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=640))
- The second, more striking finding was the speed of replay. During REM sleep, the memories were being replayed far more slowly: at just half or quarter the speed of that measured when the rats were awake and learning the maze. This slow neural recounting of the day’s events is the best evidence we have to date explaining our own protracted experience of time in human REM sleep.
  - ([Location 641](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=641))
- scientific verification of sleep requires the recording of signals, using electrodes, arising from three different regions: (1) brainwave activity, (2) eye movement activity, and (3) muscle activity.
  - ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=646))
- humans don’t just sleep, but cycle through two completely different types of sleep. They named these sleep stages based on their defining ocular features: non–rapid eye movement, or NREM, sleep, and rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep.
  - ([Location 660](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=660))
- We therefore consider waking brainwave activity as that principally concerned with the reception of the outside sensory world, while the state of deep NREM slow-wave sleep donates a state of inward reflection—one that fosters information transfer and the distillation of memories.
  - ([Location 810](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=810))
- REM sleep has also been called paradoxical sleep: a brain that appears awake, yet a body that is clearly asleep.
  - ([Location 817](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=817))
- When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).
  - ([Location 827](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=827))
- Regress evolutionary time still further and we have discovered that the very simplest forms of unicellular organisms that survive for periods exceeding twenty-four hours, such as bacteria, have active and passive phases that correspond to the light-dark cycle of our planet. It is a pattern that we now believe to be the precursor of our own [[circadian rhythm]], and with it, wake and sleep.

- Another remarkable difference in sleep across species is composition.

- falling prey to an evolutionarily imprinted lull in wakefulness that favors an afternoon nap, called the post-prandial alertness dip (from the Latin prandium, “meal”).

- implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around.

- Most striking, the very last stop on the maturational journey was the tip of the frontal lobe, which enables rational thinking and critical decision-making. Therefore, the back of the brain of an adolescent was more adult-like, while the front of the brain remained more child-like at any one moment during this developmental window of time.XIV
  - ([Location 1426](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1426))
- His findings helped explain why rationality is one of the last things to flourish in teenagers, as it is the last brain territory to receive sleep’s maturational treatment.
  - ([Location 1429](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1429))
- “Why do most 16-year-olds drive like they’re missing part of their brain? Because they are.” It takes deep sleep, and developmental time, to accomplish the neural maturation that plugs this brain “gap” within the frontal lobe.
  - ([Location 1432](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1432))
- In a separate series of studies, we have also observed that in young individuals who are at high risk of developing schizophrenia, and in teenagers and young adults with schizophrenia, there is a two- to threefold reduction in deep NREM sleep.XVII Furthermore, the electrical brainwaves of NREM sleep are not normal in their shape or number in the affected individuals. Faulty pruning of brain connections in schizophrenia caused by sleep abnormalities is now one of the most active and exciting areas of investigation in psychiatric illness.XVIII

- Adolescents face two other harmful challenges in their struggle to obtain sufficient sleep as their brains continue to develop. The first is a change in their [[circadian rhythm]]. The second is early school start times.
  - ([Location 1456](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1456))
- I will address the harmful and life-threatening effects of the latter in a later chapter; however, the complications of early school start times are inextricably linked with the first issue—a shift in [[circadian rhythm]].
  - ([Location 1457](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1457))
- children need more sleep than their older siblings or parents, but also that the [[circadian rhythm]] of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. #parenting
  - ([Location 1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1462))
- During puberty, the timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is shifted progressively forward: a change that is common across all adolescents, irrespective of culture or geography.
  - ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1464))
- asking your teenage son or daughter to go to bed and fall asleep at ten p.m. is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at seven or eight p.m. No matter how loud you enunciate the order, no matter how much that teenager truly wishes to obey your instruction, and no matter what amount of willed effort is applied by either of the two parties, the [[circadian rhythm]] of a teenager will not be miraculously coaxed into a change. 
  - ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1477))
- Central to the goal of adolescent development is the transition from parental dependence to independence, all the while learning to navigate the complexities of peer-group relationships and interactions.
  - ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1493))
- One way in which Mother Nature has perhaps helped adolescents unbuckle themselves from their parents is to march their [[circadian rhythm]]s forward in time, past that of their adult mothers and fathers. This ingenious biological solution selectively shifts teenagers to a later phase when they can, for several hours, operate independently—and do so as a peer-group collective.
  - ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1494))
- There is risk, of course. But the transition must happen. And the time of day when those independent adolescent wings unfold, and the first solo flights from the parental nest occur, is not a time of day at all, but rather a time of night, thanks to a forward-shifted [[circadian rhythm]].
  - ([Location 1498](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1498))
- There are additional scientific findings supporting the fact that older adults still need a full night of sleep, just like young adults,
  - ([Location 1510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1510))
- These three key changes are: (1) reduced quantity/quality, (2) reduced sleep efficiency, and (3) disrupted timing of sleep.

- some parts of the brain start losing neurons much earlier and far faster than other parts of the brain—a process called atrophy.
  - ([Location 1598](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1598))
- After performing hundreds of brain scans, and amassing almost a thousand hours of overnight sleep recordings, we discovered a clear answer, unfolding in a three-part story. First, the areas of the brain that suffer the most dramatic deterioration with aging are, unfortunately, the very same deep-sleep-generating regions—the middle-frontal regions seated above the bridge of the nose. When we overlaid the map of brain degeneration hot spots in the elderly on the brain map that highlighted the deep-sleep-generating regions in young adults, there was a near-perfect match. Second, and unsurprisingly, older adults suffered a 70 percent loss of deep sleep, compared with matched young individuals. Third, and most critical, we discovered that these changes were not independent, but instead significantly connected with one another: the more severe the deterioration that an older adult suffers within this specific mid-frontal region of their brain, the more dramatic their loss of deep NREM sleep. It was a saddening confirmation of my theory: the parts of our brain that ignite healthy deep sleep at night are the very same areas that degenerate, or atrophy, earliest and most severely as we age.

- Unfortunately, the hippocampus has a limited storage capacity, almost like a camera roll or, to use a more modern-day analogy, a USB memory stick. Exceed its capacity and you run the risk of not being able to add more information or, equally bad, overwriting one memory with another: a mishap called interference forgetting.
  - ([Location 1686](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1686))
- You have, as a consequence, selectively enhanced only those individual memories that you want to keep. It all sounds like the stuff of science fiction, but it is now science fact: the method is called targeted memory reactivation.
  - ([Location 1839](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1839))
- The more of those spindles a participant had during a nap, the greater the efficiency with which they strengthened items tagged for remembering
  - ([Location 1893](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1893))
- final benefit of sleep for memory is arguably the most remarkable of all: creativity. Sleep provides a nighttime theater in which your brain tests out and builds connections between vast stores of information.
  - ([Location 2045](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2045))
- In ways your waking brain would never attempt, the sleeping brain fuses together disparate sets of knowledge that foster impressive problem-solving abilities. If you ponder the type of conscious experience such outlandish memory blending would produce, you may not be surprised to learn that it happens during the dreaming state—REM sleep.

- What is the recycle rate of a human being? That is, how long can a human go without sleep before their performance is objectively impaired?
  - ([Location 2081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2081))
- Those individuals who slept eight hours every night maintained a stable, near-perfect performance across the two weeks. Those in the three-night total sleep deprivation group suffered catastrophic impairment, which was no real surprise. After the first night of no sleep at all, their lapses in concentration (missed responses) increased by over 400 percent.
  - ([Location 2104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2104))
- The recycle rate of a human being is around sixteen hours. After sixteen hours of being awake, the brain begins to fail. Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours. Three full nights of recovery sleep (i.e., more nights than a weekend) are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping. Finally, the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.

- When Dinges and Rosekind reported their findings to the FAA, they recommended that “prophylactic naps”—naps taken early during long-haul flights—should be instituted as policy among pilots, as many other aviation authorities around the world now permit.
  - ([Location 2231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2231))
- The FAA didn’t like this, either, feeling it to be too “management-like.” Their suggestion was “power napping,” which they believed was more fitting with leadership- or dominance-based job positions, others being CEOs or military executives. And so the “power nap” was born.

- Using this emotional gradient of pictures, we were able to compare the increase in brain response to the increasingly negative emotional triggers. Analysis of the brain scans revealed the largest effects I have measured in my research to date. A structure located in the left and right sides of the brain, called the amygdala—a key hot spot for triggering strong emotions such as anger and rage, and linked to the fight-or-flight response—showed well over a 60 percent amplification
  - ([Location 2270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2270))
- After a full night of sleep, the prefrontal cortex—the region of the brain that sits just above your eyeballs; is most developed in humans, relative to other primates; and is associated with rational, logical thought and decision-making—was strongly coupled to the amygdala, regulating this deep emotional brain center with inhibitory control.

- Working with mice, Nedergaard found that a kind of sewage network called the glymphatic system exists within the brain. Its name is derived from the body’s equivalent lymphatic system, but it’s composed of cells called glia (from the Greek root word for “glue”). Glial cells are distributed throughout your entire brain, situated side by side with the neurons that generate the electrical impulses of your brain.
  - ([Location 2494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2494))
- Just as the lymphatic system drains contaminants from your body, the glymphatic system collects and removes dangerous metabolic contaminants generated by the hard work performed by neurons in your brain, rather like a support team surrounding an elite athlete.
  - ([Location 2497](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2497))
- Nedergaard and her team discovered that it is during sleep that this neural sanitization work kicks into high gear.
  - ([Location 2499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2499))
- Associated with the pulsing rhythm of deep NREM sleep comes a ten- to twentyfold increase in effluent expulsion from the brain. In what can be described as a nighttime power cleanse, the purifying work of the glymphatic system is accomplished by cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain.
  - ([Location 2500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2500))
- The glial cells of the brain were shrinking in size by up to 60 percent during NREM sleep, enlarging the space around the neurons and allowing the cerebrospinal fluid to proficiently clean out the metabolic refuse left by the day’s neural activity.
  - ([Location 2503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2503))
- How does a lack of sleep hijack the body’s effective control of blood sugar? Was it a blockade of insulin release, removing the essential instruction for cells to absorb glucose? Or had the cells themselves become unresponsive to an otherwise normal and present message of insulin? As we have discovered, both are true, though the most compelling evidence indicates the latter. By taking small tissue samples, or biopsies, from participants at the end of the above experiments, we can examine how the cells of the body are operating. After participants had been restricted to four to five hours of sleep for a week, the cells of these tired individuals had become far less receptive to insulin. In this sleep-deprived state, the cells were stubbornly resisting the message from insulin and refusing to open up their surface channels. The cells were repelling rather than absorbing the dangerously high levels of glucose. The roadside drains were effectively closed shut, leading to a rising tide of blood sugar and a pre-diabetic state of hyperglycemia.

- The first concerns two hormones controlling appetite: leptin and ghrelin.II Leptin signals a sense of feeling full. When circulating levels of leptin are high, your appetite is blunted and you don’t feel like eating. Ghrelin, in contrast, triggers a strong sensation of hunger. When ghrelin levels increase, so, too, does your desire to eat.
  - ([Location 2696](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2696))
- Inadequate sleep decreased concentrations of the satiety-signaling hormone leptin and increased levels of the hunger-instigating hormone ghrelin. It was a classic case of physiological double jeopardy: participants were being punished twice for the same offense of short sleeping: once by having the “I’m full” signal removed from their system, and once by gaining the “I’m still hungry” feeling being amplified. As a result, participants just didn’t feel satisfied by food when they were short sleeping.
  - ([Location 2715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2715))
- As Van Cauter has elegantly described to me, a sleep-deprived body will cry famine in the midst of plenty.
  - ([Location 2722](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2722))
- Do you actually eat more when sleeping less? Does your waistline really swell as a consequence of that rise in appetite?
  - ([Location 2723](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2723))
- Of relevance to this behavior is a recent discovery that sleep loss increases levels of circulating endocannabinoids, which, as you may have guessed from the name, are chemicals produced by the body that are very similar to the drug cannabis. Like marijuana use, these chemicals stimulate appetite and increase your desire to snack, otherwise known as having the munchies. Combine

- Comparing the patterns of brain activity between the two conditions within the same individual, we discovered that supervisory regions in the prefrontal cortex required for thoughtful judgments and controlled decisions had been silenced in their activity by a lack of sleep.
  - ([Location 2768](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2768))
- In contrast, the more primal deep-brain structures that drive motivations and desire were amplified in response to the food images.
  - ([Location 2770](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=2770))
- This shift to a more primitive pattern of brain activity without deliberative control came with a change in the participants’ food choices. High-calorie foods became significantly more desirable in the eyes of the participants when sleep-deprived.

- Last night, you became flagrantly psychotic. It will happen again tonight. Before you reject this diagnosis, allow me to offer five justifying reasons. First, when you were dreaming last night, you started to see things that were not there—you were hallucinating. Second, you believed things that could not possibly be true—you were delusional. Third, you became confused about time, place, and person—you were disoriented. Fourth, you had extreme swings in your emotions—something psychiatrists call being affectively labile. Fifth (and how delightful!), you woke up this morning and forgot most, if not all, of this bizarre dream experience—you were suffering from amnesia.

- there are four main clusters of the brain that spike in activity when someone starts dreaming in REM sleep: (1) the visuospatial regions at the back of the brain, which enable complex visual perception; (2) the motor cortex, which instigates movement; (3) the hippocampus and surrounding regions that we have spoken about before, which support your autobiographical memory; and (4) the deep emotional centers of the brain—the amygdala and the cingulate cortex, a ribbon of tissue that sits above the amygdala and lines the inner surface of your brain—both of which help generate and process emotions.

- Mendeleev, a Russian chemist of renowned ingenuity, had an obsession. He felt there might be an organizational logic to the known elements in the universe, euphemistically described by some as the search for God’s abacus. As proof of his obsession, Mendeleev made his own set of playing cards, with each card representing one of the universal elements and its unique chemical and physical properties.

- He would sit in his office, at home, or on long train rides, and maniacally deal the shuffled deck down onto a table, one card at a time, trying to deduce the rule of all rules that would explain how this ecumenical jigsaw puzzle fit together. For years he pondered the riddle of nature. For years he failed. After allegedly having not slept for three days and three nights, he’d reached a crescendo of frustration with the challenge. While the extent of sleep deprivation seems unlikely, a clear truth was Mendeleev’s continued failure to crack the code. Succumbing to exhaustion, and with the elements still swirling in his mind and refusing organized logic, Mendeleev lay down to sleep. As he slept, he dreamed, and his dreaming brain accomplished what his waking brain was incapable of. The dream took hold of the swirling ingredients in his mind and, in a moment of creative brilliance, snapped them together in a divine grid, with each row (period) and each column (group) having a logical progression of atomic and orbiting electron characteristics, respectively. In Mendeleev’s own words:II I saw in a dream a table where all the elements fell into place as required. Awakening, I immediately wrote it down on a piece of paper. Only in one place did a correction later seem necessary.

Not because you have to suffer extreme sleep deprivation for days, but because you have to work through hundreds of miserably laborious number-string problems, almost like having to do long division for an hour or more.

Yet, the muscles that control the eyes are spared from this paralysis, and give this stage of sleep its frenetic name. Lucid dreamers were able to take advantage of this ocular freedom, communicating with the researchers through eye movements. Pre-defined eye movements would therefore inform the researchers of the nature of the lucid dream (e.g., the participant made three deliberate leftward eye movements when they gained lucid dream control, two rightward eye movements before clenching their right hand, etc.).

- In the good sleepers, the parts of the brain related to inciting emotions (the amygdala) and those linked to memory retrospection (the hippocampus) quickly ramped down in their levels of activity as they transitioned toward sleep, as did basic alertness regions in the brain stem. This was not the case for the insomnia patients.

- The sleep-wake switch within the hypothalamus has a direct line of communication to the power station regions of the brain stem. Like an electrical light switch, it can flip the power on (wake) or off (sleep). To do this, the sleep-wake switch in the hypothalamus releases a neurotransmitter called orexin. You can think of orexin as the chemical finger that flips the switch to the “on,” wakefulness, position. When orexin is released down onto your brain stem, the switch has been unambiguously flipped, powering up the wakefulness-generating centers of the brain stem. Once activated by the switch, the brain stem pushes open the sensory gate of the thalamus, allowing the perceptual world to flood into your brain, transitioning you to full, stable wakefulness. At night, the opposite happens. The sleep-wake switch stops releasing orexin onto the brain stem. The chemical finger has now flipped the switch to the “off” position, shutting down the rousing influence from the power station of the brain stem.

- What of a petite bedside lamp? How much can that really influence your suprachiasmatic nucleus? A lot, it turns out. Even a hint of dim light—8 to 10 lux—has been shown to delay the release of nighttime melatonin in humans. The feeblest of bedside lamps pumps out twice as much: anywhere from 20 to 80 lux. A subtly lit living room, where most people reside in the hours before bed, will hum at around 200 lux. Despite being just 1 to 2 percent of the strength of daylight, this ambient level of incandescent home lighting can have 50 percent of the melatonin-suppressing influence within the brain.

  - ([Location 4167](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=4167))
- Compared to reading a printed book, reading on an iPad suppressed melatonin release by over 50 percent at night. Indeed, iPad reading delayed the rise of melatonin by up to three hours, relative to the natural rise in these same individuals when reading a printed book. When reading on the iPad, their melatonin peak, and thus instruction to sleep, did not occur until the early-morning hours, rather than before midnight. Unsurprisingly, individuals took longer to fall asleep after iPad reading relative to print-copy reading.

- But did reading on the iPad actually change sleep quantity/quality above and beyond the timing of melatonin? It did, in three concerning ways. First, individuals lost significant amounts of REM sleep following iPad reading. Second, the research subjects felt less rested and sleepier throughout the day following iPad use at night. Third was a lingering aftereffect, with participants suffering a ninety-minute lag in their evening rising melatonin levels for several days after iPad use ceased—almost like a digital hangover effect.

- To successfully initiate sleep, as described in chapter 2, your core temperature needs to decrease by 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit, or about 1 degree Celsius. For this reason, you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that is too cold than too hot, since a room that is too cold is at least dragging your brain and body in the correct (downward) temperature direction for sleep.

- Knowingly or not, you have probably used this proven temperature manipulation to help your own sleep. A luxury for many is to draw a hot bath in the evening and soak the body before bedtime. We feel it helps us fall asleep more quickly, which it can, but for the opposite reason most people imagine. You do not fall asleep faster because you are toasty and warm to the core. Instead, the hot bath invites blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed appearance. When you get out of the bath, those dilated blood vessels on the surface quickly help radiate out inner heat, and your core body temperature plummets. Consequently, you fall asleep more quickly because your core is colder. Hot baths prior to bed can also induce 10 to 15 percent more deep NREM sleep in healthy adults.IV

In the 1940s, years before taking office in 1977, Begin was captured by the Soviets. He was tortured in prison by the KGB, one component of which involved prolonged sleep deprivation. Of this experience (which most governments benignly describe as the practice of “prisoner sleep management”), he writes: In the head of the interrogated prisoner a haze begins to form. His spirit is wearied to death, his legs are unsteady, and he has one sole desire: to sleep, to sleep just a little, not to get up, to lie, to rest, to forget . . . Anyone who has experienced this desire knows that not even hunger or thirst are comparable with it . . . I came across prisoners who signed what they were ordered to sign, only to get what their interrogator promised them. He did not promise them their liberty. He promised them—if they signed—uninterrupted sleep.

- Consider the infamous reactor meltdown at the Chernobyl nuclear power station on April 26, 1986. The radiation from the disaster was one hundred times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped in World War II. It was the fault of sleep-deprived operators working an exhaustive shift, occurring, without coincidence, at one a.m.

- For me, addressing this issue involves two steps of logic. First, we must understand why the problem of deficient sleep seems to be so resistant to change, and thus persists and grows worse. Second, we must develop a structured model for effecting change at every possible leverage point we can identify. There is not going to be a single, magic-bullet solution.

- data. As Aetna chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini described, “Being present in the workplace and making better decisions has a lot to do with our business fundamentals.” He further noted, “You can’t be prepared if you’re half asleep.”

- I wholeheartedly endorse Bertolini’s idea, though I would modify it in the following way. Rather than—or as an alternative to—providing financial bonuses, we could offer added vacation time. Many individuals value time off more than modest financial perks. I would suggest a “sleep credit system,” with sleep time being exchanged for either financial bonuses or extra vacation days.

- Appendix Twelve Tips for Healthy SleepI 1. Stick to a sleep schedule. Go to bed and wake up at the same time each day. As creatures of habit, people have a hard time adjusting to changes in sleep patterns. Sleeping later on weekends won’t fully make up for a lack of sleep during the week and will make it harder to wake up early on Monday morning. Set an alarm for bedtime. Often we set an alarm for when it’s time to wake up but fail to do so for when it’s time to go to sleep. If there is only one piece of advice you remember and take from these twelve tips, this should be it. 2. Exercise is great, but not too late in the day. Try to exercise at least thirty minutes on most days but not later than two to three hours before your bedtime. 3. Avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, certain teas, and chocolate contain the stimulant caffeine, and its effects can take as long as eight hours to wear off fully. Therefore, a cup of coffee in the late afternoon can make it hard for you to fall asleep at night. Nicotine is also a stimulant, often causing smokers to sleep only very lightly. In addition, smokers often wake up too early in the morning because of nicotine withdrawal. 4. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Having a nightcap or alcoholic beverage before sleep may help you relax, but heavy use robs you of REM sleep, keeping you in the lighter stages of sleep. Heavy alcohol ingestion also may contribute to impairment in breathing at night. You also tend to wake up in the middle of the night when the effects of the alcohol have worn off. 5. Avoid large meals and beverages late at night. A light snack is okay, but a large meal can cause indigestion, which interferes with sleep. Drinking too many fluids at night can cause frequent awakenings to urinate. 6. If possible, avoid medicines that delay or disrupt your sleep. Some commonly prescribed heart, blood pressure, or asthma medications, as well as some over-the-counter and herbal remedies for coughs, colds, or allergies, can disrupt sleep patterns. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your health care provider or pharmacist to see whether any drugs you’re taking might be contributing to your insomnia and ask whether they can be taken at other times during the day or early in the evening. 7. Don’t take naps after 3 p.m. Naps can help make up for lost sleep, but late afternoon naps can make it harder to fall asleep at night. 8. Relax before bed. Don’t overschedule your day so that no time is left for unwinding. A relaxing activity, such as reading or listening to music, should be part of your bedtime ritual. 9. Take a hot bath before bed. The drop in body temperature after getting out of the bath may help you feel sleepy, and the bath can help you relax and slow down so you’re more ready to sleep. 10. Dark bedroom, cool bedroom, gadget-free bedroom. Get rid of anything in your bedroom that might distract you from sleep, such as noises, bright lights, an uncomfortable bed, or warm temperatures. You…
