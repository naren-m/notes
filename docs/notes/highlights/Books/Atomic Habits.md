### Highlights

- psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg. (Location 200)
- Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the aggregation of marginal gains,” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do. (Location 232)
  - **Note:** Aggregational marginal change
- Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” (Location 235)
  - **Note:** [[One percent rule]]

- Time magnifies the margin between [[success]] and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. (Location 317)

- Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once. (Location 372)
- “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” (Location 376)
- Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to those results. (Location 402)

- of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” (Location 414)
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals. (Location 420)
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change. (Location 429)
- Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. (Location 434)
- What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. (Location 436)
- Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves. (Location 438)
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress. (Location 452)
- True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. (Location 458)
- You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. (Location 463)
- atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do, but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth. (Location 473)
- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. (Location 494)
- Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe. (Location 509)
- The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become. (Location 516)
- It’s one thing to say I’m the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who is this. (Location 554)
  - **Note:** Figurethe identityreate to self
- The more you repeat a behavior, the more you reinforce the identity associated with that behavior. (Location 606)
- In fact, the word identity was originally derived from the Latin words essentitas, which means being, and identidem, which means repeatedly. Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness.” (Location 607)
  - **Note:** Idetiry is literally repeated beingness
- It is a simple two-step process: 1. Decide the type of person you want to be. 2. Prove it to yourself with small wins. (Location 649)
- identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way (Location 669)
- Chapter Summary There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. (Location 689)
- From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating, “behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” (Location 718)
  - **Note:** Cat exoperiet
- As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha writes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.” (Location 739)
- steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. * (Location 773)
- Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. (Location 803)
  - **Note:** 4 stages of habit
- If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. (Location 815)
- The brain is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results. The entire process is completed in a split second, and we use it again and again without realizing everything that has been packed into the previous moment. (Location 830)
- We can split these four steps into two phases: the problem phase and the solution phase. The problem phase includes the cue and the craving, and it is when you realize that something needs to change. The solution phase includes the response and the reward, and it is when you take action and achieve the change you desire. (Location 833)

- Whenever you want to change your behavior, you can simply ask yourself: 1. How can I make it obvious? 2. How can I make it attractive? 3. How can I make it easy? 4. How can I make it satisfying? (Location 889)

- Chapter Summary A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic. The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.

- As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” (Location 971)
- This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. (Location 981)
- Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. (Location 983)
- “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?” (Location 1022)
- Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. (Location 1037)
- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. (Location 1042)
- Chapter Summary With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing. The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them. Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions. The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. (Location 1044)
- “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on \[DAY\] at \[TIME\] in \[PLACE\].” (Location 1062)
- The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit. (Location 1066)
- “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.” (Location 1072)
- The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. (Location 1081)
- Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. (Location 1088)
- with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. (Location 1107)
- “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work out.” (Location 1108)
- professor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking. (Location 1111)
- The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. (Location 1129)
- One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking. (Location 1139)
- Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. (Location 1141)
- Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. (Location 1201)
- Chapter Summary The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious. The two most common cues are time and location. Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location. The implementation intention formula is: I will \[BEHAVIOR\] at \[TIME\] in \[LOCATION\]. Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit. The habit stacking formula is: After \[CURRENT HABIT\], I will \[NEW HABIT\]. (Location 1214)
- Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f (P,E). (Location 1248)
- In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” (Location 1250)

- In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year. (Location 1297)

- Chapter Summary Small changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior over time. Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue. It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues. (Location 1388)
- In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations. (Location 1426)
- Watching television makes you feel sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the energy to do anything else. (Location 1444)
- Chapter Summary The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it invisible. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. (Location 1475)
- supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual. (Location 1518)
- Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much smaller. They (Location 1613)
- Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” (Location 1655)
- Chapter Summary The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act. It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike. Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. (Location 1676)

- The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an obsession with chess was normal. (Location 1711)
- French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along.” Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden. (Location 1730)
- We imitate the habits of three groups in particular: 1. The close. 2. The many. 3. The powerful. Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive. (Location 1736)
- Chapter Summary The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige). One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. Most days, we’d rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves. If a behavior can get us approval, respect, and praise, we find it attractive. (Location 1848)
- To summarize, the specific cravings you feel and habits you perform are really an attempt to address your fundamental underlying motives. (Location 1946)
- I began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done with my ritual, I was in “game mode.” (Location 1996)
- Chapter Summary The inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it unattractive. Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper underlying motive. Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them. The prediction leads to a feeling. Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit to make it seem unattractive. Habits are attractive when we associate them with positive feelings and unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.

- As Voltaire once wrote, “The best is the enemy of the good.” (Location 2049)
- If you want to master a habit, the key is to start with repetition, not perfection. You don’t need to map out every feature of a new habit. You just need to practice it. This is the first takeaway of the 3rd Law: you just need to get your reps in. (Location 2069)
- neuropsychologist Donald Hebb in 1949, this phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.” (Location 2078)
- All habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. (Location 2101)
- Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over. (Location 2102)
- Chapter Summary The 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it easy. The most effective form of learning is practice, not planning. Focus on taking action, not being in motion. Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it. (Location 2129)
- It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.\* (Location 2167)
- This is precisely what electronics manufacturers in Japan began to do in the 1970s. In an article published in the New Yorker titled “Better All the Time,” James Suroweicki writes: “Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls for American-made color televisions were five times as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long to assemble their sets.” (Location 2215)
- addition by subtraction. (Location 2223)
- “When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape. . . . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.” (Location 2258)
- “How can we design a world where it’s easy to do what’s right?” (Location 2297)
- Chapter Summary Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible. Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult. Prime your environment to make future actions easier. (Location 2298)
- TWYLA THARP IS widely regarded as one of the greatest dancers and choreographers (Location 2306)

- What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path. (Location 2363)
- Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said. Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. (Location 2410)
- technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. (Location 2420)
- Chapter Summary Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward. Many habits occur at decisive moments—choices that are like a fork in the road—and either send you in the direction of a productive day or an unproductive one. The Two-Minute Rule states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.” The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist. (Location 2442)
- Victor Hugo and make your bad habits more difficult by creating what psychologists call a commitment device. (Location 2462)
- A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. (Location 2463)
- Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction. (Location 2496)
- Chapter Summary The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is make it difficult. A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future. The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits. Onetime choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time. Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.

- delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff. The human (Location 2678)
- The distant future was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long- term ones. Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time.\* You value the present more than the future. (Location 2692)
- As a general rule, the more immediate pleasure you get from an action, the more strongly you should question whether it aligns with your long-term goals. * (Location 2719)
- The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. (Location 2749)
- The best approach is to use reinforcement, which refers to the process of using an immediate reward to increase the rate of a behavior. (Location 2750)
- Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. (Location 2754)
- Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit. (Location 2780)
- Chapter Summary The 4th Law of Behavior Change is make it satisfying. We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided. To get a habit to stick you need to feel immediately successful— even if it’s in a small way. The first three laws of behavior change— make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time. The fourth law of behavior change— make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. (Location 2786)

- Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious. (Location 2832)
- Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive. (Location 2844)
- Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying. (Location 2851)
- habit tracking (1) creates a visual cue that can remind you to act, (2) is inherently motivating because you see the progress you are making and don’t want to lose it, and (3) feels satisfying whenever you record another successful instance of your habit. (Location 2858)
- Once you know where to get the data, add a note to your calendar to review it each week or each month, which is more practical than tracking it every day. (Location 2878)
- No matter how consistent you are with your habits, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some point. Perfection is not possible. (Location 2893)
- never miss twice. (Location 2896)
- The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. (Location 2899)
- The breaking of a habit doesn’t matter if the reclaiming of it is fast. I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as completely as I would like. (Location 2903)
- As Charlie Munger says, “The first rule of compounding: Never interrupt it unnecessarily.” (Location 2910)
- we optimize for what we measure. When we choose the wrong measurement, we get the wrong behavior. (Location 2937)
- Charles Goodhart, the principle states, “When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.” (Location 2939)
- Chapter Summary One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress. A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit—like marking an X on a calendar. Habit trackers and other visual forms of measurement can make your habits satisfying by providing clear evidence of your progress. Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive. Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible. Just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. (Location 2958)
- The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. (Location 2987)
- If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds. (Location 2991)
- there is a straightforward way to add an immediate cost to any bad habit: create a habit contract. (Location 3007)
- and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day, Harris lost the weight (Location 3047)
