### Highlights

- But the story of the golden calf also reminds us that without rules we quickly become slaves to our passions—and there’s nothing freeing about that. ([Location 70](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=70))
- Cultivating judgment about the difference between virtue and vice is the beginning of wisdom, something that can never be out of date. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=265))
- Intolerance of others’ views (no matter how ignorant or incoherent they may be) is not simply wrong; in a world where there is no right or wrong, it is worse: it is a sign you are embarrassingly unsophisticated or, possibly, dangerous. ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=272))
- In the West, we have been withdrawing from our tradition-, religion- and even nation-centred cultures, partly to decrease the danger of group conflict. But we are increasingly falling prey to the desperation of meaninglessness, and that is no improvement at all. ([Location 455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=455))
- In consequence, males who stay on top longer are those who form reciprocal coalitions with their lower-status compatriots, and who pay careful attention to the troupe’s females and their infants. The political ploy of baby-kissing is literally millions of years old. ([Location 688](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=688))
- Mark Twain once said, “It’s not what we don’t know that gets us in trouble. It’s what we know for sure that just ain’t so.” ([Location 713](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=713))
- It is more that creatures are in a dance with nature, albeit one that is deadly. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=733))
- If Mother Nature wasn’t so hell-bent on our destruction, it would be easier for us to exist in simple harmony with her dictates. ([Location 748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01FPGY5T0&location=748))
