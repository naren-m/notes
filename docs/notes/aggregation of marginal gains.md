# aggregation of marginal gains

[[Atomic Habits]]


- Brailsford had been hired to put British Cycling on a new trajectory. What made him different from previous coaches was his relentless commitment to a strategy that he referred to as “the [[aggregation of marginal gains]],” which was the philosophy of searching for a tiny margin of improvement in everything you do.

  - **Note:** Aggregational marginal change
- Brailsford said, “The whole principle came from the idea that if you broke down everything you could think of that goes into riding a bike, and then improve it by 1 percent, you will get a significant increase when you put them all together.” (Location 235)
  - **Note:** [[One percent rule]]
