# Big Bang

- point—to forge these heavy elements, you need the kind of heat and energy of a [[Big Bang]]. Yet there has been only one [[Big Bang]] and it didn't produce them. So where did they come from? Interestingly, the man who found the answer to that question was a cosmologist who heartily despised the [[Big Bang]] as a theory and coined the term “[[Big Bang]]” sarcastically, as a way of mocking it.
