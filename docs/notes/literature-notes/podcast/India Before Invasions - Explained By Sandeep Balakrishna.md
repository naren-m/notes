## Notes

Most of Chinese cultural medince is based on Anicent Indian Ayurveda AD 2nd century text named [[Navneetakam]].


satisfy your need for happiness through your own curiosity with the r show Islamic invasions let's talk about the story okay okay um why don't we begin with what happened pre-islamic invasions in India MH like in terms of what was uh the landscape the culture of all Indians at that point in the subcontinent and by subcontinent I also mean Pakistan I also mean Afghanistan why don't you draw out a cultural historical geographical map as well as an economic map as well as a um kind of blueprint about what went wrong that these invasions became successful because technically the winners of War right history mhm so we were The Losers of war in that period if we lost War there was something that went wrong on on our side it's like losing a cricket game and then you go back to say that oh between overs 20 and 30 we didn't do this okay so highlight that also because it's important to study history from a uh psychological perspective so that history doesn't repeat itself sure that's a lot of ground you have asked me to cover feel free where so broadly speaking uh India had had external invasions before uh Islam uh the earliest recorded is by alander then the hunas came in Hans shakas came in pavis came in so multiple guys came but they did not do significant damage one two they were all pre-islamic invasions which means the faith called Islam had not yet been born in this world okay all right same Geographic and and the Greek invasions began even before Christianity had begun had taken route even in the west so they didn't do uh significant damage to us due to various factors we had extraordinary strong kingdoms and the modes of travel climate weather all those Hindu Kush mountains and then the karakurum pass it was very hostile territory the Himalayas even today it is still our natural Fortress all right so on the socio religious cultural landscape it was a rather homogeneous uh uh Society in one sense you had different uh uh schools of which which were the offshoots of Hindu Dharma itself mainly the viika school and second the Buddhist school and you know much later you had other uh schools like Shaka sha vnaa much later they came so this was roughly the uh social religious landscape now on the economic landscape India was the world's largest economy okay second only to China sometimes the equations would change roughly here and there now on the political side we were characterized by you know sweeping Empires under one king it could be it began with Chandra Gupta MAA and Then followed by uh satavahanas guptas all these sweeping large Empires as big as some 10 European countries that was the size of one Empire ruled by one Monarch so this was roughly the political thing and uh there was cultural unity in the sense that although we the Hindu mind there was no non-hindu influence in that sense by that time so the Hindu mind had always had a sense of India's geographical body borders and they were United culturally which is still the case today why would someone uh you're familiar with panchang right almanak Hindu calendar okay so what does it contain it contains a list of you know various festivals tiis and you know everything let's take the case of Ganesh chaturti you are in Bombay so across India this Festival celebrated different here the importance is too much so you check out the panang what it says on Ganesh chaturti where all is is it is celebrated not just in Maharashtra but across India all the famous Ganesha temples on this day cons and why it is done so this shows your cultural unity in the sense of both geography space and time time as Festival indicated by a day of the festival space in different parts of India so this was always there in our psyche it is still there why should I go to in why should I go to Jane or why should I go to ramesham or why should somebody staying in jalander come all the way till kanchipuram H right why should the SAR for kamakya Dei temple in Assam till date it goes from it is stitched in kipur so which law which rule book tells you to do this which which created this system the purohit in pashupatinath Temple in Nepal he comes from South canra in Karnataka H compulsory so if you next time you go there you speak to him him in Canada he'll reply to in Canada so which system created this what created this so it is the what is known as sadhana tapasa it is a long process of trial and error and you know a profound kind of evolution so this was the cultural landscape back then all right political cultural economic then uh uh what was other thing something else you ask psychological psychological is uh uh I wouldn't use that word psychological but this was how it was roughly spread okay what we also did was that I don't like to use this term but since it is fashionable now I'll use it India was the greatest EX exporter of culture true when our businessmen went out in Caravans they took Hindu culture with them and wherever they went they told stories from India from jat stories from hitopadesha from panchatantra from Ramana Mahabharata vishu bhagavatam wherever they went uh even in the Middle East you see you trace the history of folklore in Persia turkey Middle East you will find a Hindu element there so this has happened more than two minimum two 2,000 years ago it was a continuous exchange until you know Islam cut it off this this used to be there and what is known today known as southeast Asia there the influence it is an extension counter of Hindu culture actually speaking what made this possible unless you have this kind of political power which is also an enlightened political power you don't need swords to go out and kill and Conquer and then you know impose your culture two ways to do this right one is you know chop off and then convert or you know forcibly impose your culture on unwilling population or you do this you have your secure borders your secure you're secure in political Kingdom uh Power you know how to defend your borders from both intern external threats and then culture automatically spreads itself even China till date it hates India for a reason that you know without firing a single shot without throwing a single Ward India culturally conquered China a lot of Chinese medicine owes to a 2 Century ad aurvedic text named naanam if you enjoyed today's clip make sure you check out these
