# Block Cipher

A block cipher is an algorithm, when applied to a data source, decomposes the input and processes one chunk (block) at a time.

The algorithm processes the blocks in order.
Basically, a block takes nibbles instead of eating an entire meal at one.

Would you like to add some salt to that sandwich? You can always seed your input with a unique value. When mixed in with normal [[Hashing]], this adds another level of unpredictability.
