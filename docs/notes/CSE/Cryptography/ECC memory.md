# ECC memory

Error Correcting Code Memory (ECC memory) is supposedly resilient to [[Rowhammer]] attacks. ECC memory detects bit tampering and amazingly corrects the change. This would seem to be an effective mitigation.
ECC is used in sensitive systems, such as financial systems and IoT devices, because this sort of exploitation is especially troublesome.
