# Zero Day Attack


If a hacker manages to exploit the vulnerability before software developers can find a fix, that exploit becomes known as a zero day attack.

Zero day vulnerabilities can take almost any form, because they can manifest as
any type of broader software vulnerability.

For example, they could take the form of missing
- [[Data encryption]]
- [[SQL injection]]
- [[Buffer Overflows]]
- missing authorizations
- broken algorithms
- URL redirects
- bugs
- or problems with password security.

This makes zero day vulnerabilities difficult to proactively find—which in some ways is good news, because it also means hackers will have a hard time finding them. But it also means it’s difficult to guard against these vulnerabilities effectively.
