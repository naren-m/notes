# CIA Triad

CIA Triad is a reference to [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]], and [[availability]], which are the pillars of security. 


Each is a category of security:

## Confidentiality

Confidentiality is the heart of cryptography, which is protecting sensitive data.
Applying encryption to data provides confidentiality.

## Integrity

Integrity is about trust. Knowing whether data is reliable is essential in preventing attacks.

[[Hashing]] algorithms are used to confirm integrity.

## Availability

Availability means resources and services are available as expected.

Digital signatures, a combination of [[Hashing]] and [[Encryption]], can help protect against non-availability by preventing unauthorized users.
