# Fingerprint

What is a digital fingerprint?
There is often confusion about the definition of a digital fingerprint versus [[digital signatures]].
A digital fingerprint is a hash of a [[public key]] (discussed shortly).
Two parties with shared knowledge of a [[public key]] can exchange the key using the hash. The hash becomes a factor for authentication.
