# Hashing

Hashing is the process of converting a given key into another value. A hash function is used to generate the new value according to a mathematical algorithm. The result of a hash function is known as a hash value or simply, a hash.

Hashing -> Security

A good hash function uses a one-way [[Hash Algorithms]], or in other words, the hash cannot be converted back into the original key.

Hashing is a one-way algorithm that creates a fixed length digest (transformation) from input data.
Features of hashing include:
- Hashing is conducted in sequential blocks
- There is no detectable pattern
- The results are both unpredictable and predictable
- Longer digests tend to be more secure


Hashing protects the [[Integrity]] of data. With a hash, you can detect tampering

Hashing is different than [[Checksum]].
