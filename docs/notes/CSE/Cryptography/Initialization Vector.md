An initialization vector (IV) adds another ingredient to the asymmetric [[encryption]] algorithm, which makes the digest less predictable. Adversaries can use predictability to glean information from patterns and exploit [[security vulnerabilities]]. For that reason, an IV makes [[encryption]] more secure.
