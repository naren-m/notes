When a computer is shutdown, data in the memory chips may persists for a few seconds, even minutes after the abrupt shutdown. Memory in the DRAM and SRAM are especially vulnerable to this sort of attack.
Most often the system is rebooted from a operating system on a secondary device, such as a usb stick. The hacker can then employ various techniques for dumping the sensitive information.


As an extension to the cold boot attack, you can actually freeze memory chips using liquid nitrogen, freeze sprays, and other techniques. When cooled, the memory will take longer to erode. This provides the hacker more time to remove sensitive data from the impacted memory.
