Idea is to put conscious effort to [[Maintaining code base]] making small incremental
quantifiable changes to the code base.

- Pick one small piece of code that you can make better in couple of hours
- Make a "how to use" article/wiki.
- Add unit test to existing code. Try and increase coverage by [[One percent rule]]
- Add automation for an existing uncovered use case.
