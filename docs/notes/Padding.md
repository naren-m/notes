# Padding

Encrypted data has a definitive start and end, based on the input. Hackers can potentially exploit this predictability. Yup, predictability again!
[[Encryption]] padding adds “random stuffing,” which further obfuscates the result. These are the two most popular padding schemes:
- OAEP (Optimal Asymmetric [[Encryption]] Padding)
- PKCS1 ([[Public Key]] [[Cryptography]] Standards)

The details of padding algorithms are beyond the scope of this course.
