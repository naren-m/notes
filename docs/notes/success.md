## [[Outliers]] 

says success is not personal, we owe some part of it to parentage and patronage. i agree with that fact. We are previlaged to be born in a family that can afford for our education and we are hard working enought to get to a spot.

- ***Achievement is talent plus preparation***.

  - The problem with this view is thatthe careers of the gifted,

## [[Grit]]

Pete’s idol, basketball coach John Wooden, was fond of saying, “Success is never final; failure is never fatal. It’s courage that counts.” What I wanted to know is how a culture of grit continues not just in the afterglow of success, but in the aftermath of failure. What I wanted to know is how Pete and the Seahawks found the courage to continue. ([Location 3684](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3684))

## [[Atomic Habits]]

- Time magnifies the margin between [[success]] and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy. (Location 317)
