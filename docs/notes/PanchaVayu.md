# PanchaVayu


The Sanskrit word [[Vayu]] translates as “wind,” and the root ‘va’ translates to “that which flows.”

Thus a Vayu is an energetic force that moves in a specific direction to control bodily functions and activities.

The ancient yogis found 49 distinct types of Vayus in the body.

Only five of the main Vayus or Pancha Pranas are important for yoga practitioners to understand.

These five primary currents of vital force are

1. Prana-Vayu
2. Apana-Vayu
3. Samana-Vayu
4. Udana-Vayu
5. Vyana-Vayu


## Prana Vayu

- To strengthen Prana-Vayu: Practicing pranayamas like Bhastrika, Nadi Shodhana and Ujjayi Pranayama will quickly strengthen this Vayu.  Heart-opening yoga poses like bow pose, camel pose, cobra pose, dancer pose, and bridge pose will activate and strengthen the Prana-Vayu. To encourage this vital wind to flow upward practice inversions and poses with raised arms like Warrior I, Chair pose, and Mountain pose. Bringing awareness of Prana-Vayu in any yoga pose creates a focus to lift, lengthen and open the upper body.
