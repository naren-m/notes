## Snippets from [[Outliers]]

- There were only two parenting “philosophies,” and they divided almost perfectly along class lines. The wealthier parents raised their kids one way, and the poorer parents raised their kids another way.

- The middle-class parents talked things through with their children, reasoning with them. They didn’t just issue commands. They expected their children to talk back to them, to negotiate, to question adults in positions of authority. #parenting

- If their children were doing poorly at school, the wealthier parents challenged their teachers. They intervened on behalf of their kids. #parenting

  - **Note:** Rich parents intervene in their kids life a lot


- Lareau calls the middle-class parenting style “concerted cultivation.” It’s an attempt to actively “foster and assess a child’s talents, opinions and skills.”

  - **Note:** Broad philosophy of child upbringing #parenting
- Poor parents tend to follow, by contrast, a strategy of “accomplishment of natural growth.” They see as their responsibility to care for their children but to let them grow and develop on their own. #parenting

- Lareau stresses that one style isn’t morally better than the other. The poorer children were, to her mind, often better behaved, less whiny, more creative in making use of their own time, and had a well-developed sense of independence. But in practical terms, concerted cultivation has enormous advantages. The heavily scheduled middle-class child is exposed to a constantly shifting set of experiences. She learns teamwork and how to cope in highly structured settings. She is taught how to interact comfortably with adults, and to speak up when she needs to. In Lareau’s words, the middle-class children learn a sense of “entitlement.” #parenting

- the working-class and poor children were characterized by “an emerging sense of distance, distrust, and constraint.” They didn’t know how to get their way, or how to “customize”—using Lareau’s wonderful term—whatever environment they were in, for their best purposes.

## [[Why We Sleep]]

- children need more sleep than their older siblings or parents, but also that the [[circadian rhythm]] of a young child runs on an earlier schedule. #parenting
  - ([Location 1462](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1462))
- During puberty, the timing of the suprachiasmatic nucleus is shifted progressively forward: a change that is common across all adolescents, irrespective of culture or geography.
  - ([Location 1464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1464))
- asking your teenage son or daughter to go to bed and fall asleep at ten p.m. is the circadian equivalent of asking you, their parent, to go to sleep at seven or eight p.m. No matter how loud you enunciate the order, no matter how much that teenager truly wishes to obey your instruction, and no matter what amount of willed effort is applied by either of the two parties, the [[circadian rhythm]] of a teenager will not be miraculously coaxed into a change. 
  - ([Location 1477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1477))
- Central to the goal of adolescent development is the transition from parental dependence to independence, all the while learning to navigate the complexities of peer-group relationships and interactions.
  - ([Location 1493](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1493))
- One way in which Mother Nature has perhaps helped adolescents unbuckle themselves from their parents is to march their [[circadian rhythm]]s forward in time, past that of their adult mothers and fathers. This ingenious biological solution selectively shifts teenagers to a later phase when they can, for several hours, operate independently—and do so as a peer-group collective.
  - ([Location 1494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06ZZ1YGJ5&location=1494))
- There is risk, of course. But the transition must happen. And the time of day when those independent adolescent wings unfold, and the first solo flights from the parental nest occur, is not a time of day at all, but rather a time of night, thanks to a forward-shifted [[circadian rhythm]].

## [[Grit]]

- The word #parenting derives from Latin and means “to bring forth.” You’re acting in a parentlike way if you’re asking for guidance on how to best bring forth interest, practice, purpose, and hope in the people you care for. ([Location 2748](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2748))
- In his best-selling 1928 #parenting guide, Psychological Care of Infant and Child, Watson holds forth on how to raise a child “who loses himself in work and play, who quickly learns to overcome the small difficulties in his environment . . . and who finally enters manhood so bulwarked with stable work and emotional habits that no adversity can quite overwhelm him.” ([Location 2757](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2757))
- On the continuum between supportive and demanding #parenting, proponents of this permissive “child-centered” approach fall to the left of center. ([Location 2769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2769))
- “Actually,” Alex said, “I think I’m allergic to spoiled children. Children must be loved and accepted, but then, without complications, they need to be taught: ‘No, you cannot hit your sister on the head with that stick. Yes, you must share. No, you don’t get to have everything you want when you want it.’ It’s no-nonsense #parenting.” ([Location 2891](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2891))
- First and foremost, there’s no either/or trade-off between supportive #parenting and demanding #parenting. It’s a common misunderstanding to think of “tough love” as a carefully struck balance between affection and respect on the one hand, and firmly enforced expectations on the other. In actuality, there’s no reason you can’t do both. Very clearly, this is exactly what the parents of Steve Young and Francesca Martinez did. The Youngs were tough, but they were also loving. The Martinezes were loving, but they were also tough. Both families were “child-centered” in the sense that they clearly put their children’s interests first, but neither family felt that children were always the better judge of what to do, how hard to work, and when to give up on things.

- Below is a figure representing how many psychologists now categorize #parenting styles. Instead of one continuum, there are two. In the upper right-hand quadrant are parents who are both demanding and supportive. The technical term is “authoritative #parenting,” which, unfortunately is easily confused with “authoritarian #parenting.” To avoid such confusion, I’ll refer to authoritative #parenting as wise #parenting, because parents in this quadrant are accurate judges of the psychological needs of their children. They appreciate that children need love, limits, and latitude to reach their full potential. Their authority is based on knowledge and wisdom, rather than power. ([Location 2925](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2925))
- One of the major discoveries of #parenting research is that what matters more than the messages parents aim to deliver are the messages their children receive. ([Location 2943](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2943))
- Are you a psychologically wise parent? Use the #parenting assessment on the next page, developed by psychologist and #parenting expert Nancy Darling, as a checklist to find out. How many of these statements would your child affirm without hesitation? You’ll notice that some of the items are italicized. These are “reverse-coded” items, meaning that if your child agrees with them, you may be less psychologically wise than you think. Supportive: Warm I can count on my parents to help me out if I have a problem. My parents spend time just talking to me. My parents and I do things that are fun together. My parents don’t really like me to tell them my troubles. My parents hardly ever praise me for doing well. Supportive: Respectful My parents believe I have a right to my own point of view. My parents tell me that their ideas are correct and that I shouldn’t question them. My parents respect my privacy. My parents give me a lot of freedom. My parents make most of the decisions about what I can do. Demanding My parents really expect me to follow family rules. My parents really let me get away with things. My parents point out ways I could do better. When I do something wrong, my parents don’t punish me. My parents expect me to do my best even when it’s hard.

- If you want to bring forth grit in your child, first ask how much passion and perseverance you have for your own life goals. Then ask yourself how likely it is that your approach to #parenting encourages your child to emulate you. If the answer to the first question is “a great deal,” and your… ([Location 2992](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=2992))
- Supportive and demanding #parenting is psychologically wise and encourages children to emulate their parents. It stands to reason that supportive and demanding leadership would do the same. ([Location 3705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B010MH9V3W&location=3705))
