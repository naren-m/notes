- Rishi Atri Observed solar eclipse in [[Rigveda]]
  - Bala gangadhar tilak, decoded rigveda and identified that Atri observed solar eclipse using an apperatus
  - The apperatus is [[Thuriya yantra]]

- 2022 Nature magazine, 2 papers
  - 7176 BC, Solar flare was so big that the graphs in the paper shows completely
  - 7176 BC, Proton event
  - Surya became brilliant overtime during that period.
    - Since sun was so bright, Sanjana could not take the heat and she abandons her husband and she goes off to the cooler region.
      - This could be describing the solar flare event.
    - Keeps chaya in her place.
  - Sun has 11 year sunspot cycle. When sunspots go to a maximum, there is a propensity for the sun to have a coronal mass ejection (CME) event.
    - Charged particles are thrown out of the sun. If we are unlucky, it comes towards the earth. 
    - Normally we are ok because we got the magnetic lines of force and these are all charged particles so they are conducted away to the north pole and south pole by our magnetic lines. 
      Typically what happens is they interact in the upper atmosphere and there is all kind of isotopic activity that takes place. 
      Radio activity takes place at the north pole and south pole. That is why we get [[aurora borealis]], northern lights, southern lights are because of this activity.
      Typically those radioactive particles rain down on the earth in these polar regions and they are preserved in the ice. They are preserved in the ice. Normally it is not a point for contention.
      Typically satellites are concerned with there will be damage radio communication damage. No biggie. 
      The biggest solar flare we have in recorded history goes back approximately 1856 or so. 
      It is called [[the Carrington]] event. 
      Not only in the polar region. Normally you know aurora borealis about a few latitudes to the north from the north pole. 
      This northern light was seen up to Hawaii, up to China. That is how far these lights had come. It was that powerful a storm. 
      Not only that there were operators in the United States and Portland those days.
      Scientists are estimating this 7176 BC to be an order of magnitude bigger than [[Carrington event]] logarithmically 10 times larger. 
      And this they have found by drilling the ice course in Antarctica, ice course in Greenland. 
      It is like a time capsule

## Transcript

the special forces of the Navy of the Indian Navy it's called the Marcos whose 
job was to dive deep and investigate dwarka this was identified by Baka 100 years 
ago he's been talking about it daka's shape of the harbor and everything seems to be similar to what he's found here 22,000 to 18,000 years
ago Earth went through an ice Ag and this ice AG is called last glacial maximum and 
this resulted in so much of water locked up in ice that the shorelines are visible far beyond where they are today draw out a picture of the Ice Age for people who've not seen the animated movie earlier Ice Ages were even more s even beyond the Himalayas maybe up to New Delhi and others maybe we had ice ages over here in 2050 we could have water levels Chennai could be submerged Kolkata and Bangladesh many places could be submerged Mumbai also could suffer a lot of submer livs would you like to bring in astrology there is no such thing as astrology we only had joa Indians could Mark the passage of time mely by looking at where is the move against which backdrop of star is that this is fantastic I don't know why I'm getting Goosebumps but I'm getting Goosebumps and I remember my mom reading out the story to me from the comic book and then I asked her are these people are these aliens and she didn't really have an answer and I remember my question mark just stopping there cut to 2023 and I've got my answer that these are celestial events encapsulated in Stories the stories traveled from 7,000 BC yes 9,000 years to present 2001 when I read that at her comic book and this is one story how many other stories are relaying how much of our past absolutely these stories areen intentionally to encode knowledge there's a lot to be decoded in the wayas precisely done so many episodes on Indian history on Indian culture on what people call mythology which is an offensive word for so many Indians this particular podcast contains all of these topics and much more because it's centered around astronomy as well the science of our solar system system how our solar system is linked to Indian culture how our ancients discovered secrets about astronomy if you're someone who enjoys all these cultural conversations you're going to enjoy this one but trust me I feel every Indian should watch this podcast because this is the true deep history of our land the ancient history of our land before 10,000 BC lots of different topics have been addressed in this one had a lot of fun recording this I'm sure you're going to have a lot of fun listening to this special conversation with Raj [Music] vam how are you Raj vam sir I'm very fine thank you ranir it's a real pleasure to be here it's a privilege too to be on your show so thank you for inviting me appreciate your presence here sir um you do a bunch of things that's what I find the most fascinating about you uh began as an engineer you did your doctorate now you've kind of dedicated your life to unearthing the hidden history of India uh there's a lot of people who have heard this first sentence itself and switched off because according to a lot of people you need to be a historian to be able to talk about this after doing more than like 550 episodes I've realized that knowledge is gained when there's curiosity for the knowledge to be gained and as long as you're following the techniques that historians follow um you're doing a just job but of course there will be people who will switch off anyway so this podcast is for everyone else who's willing to be open who's willing to learn outstanding outstanding see there's a tendency to be for people to be gatekeeping gatekeeping in the sense that how are you credential to do this kind of thing often I tell them I'm an engineer I'm interested in knowing what were the contributions of my ancestors to some Science and Technology who else is better qualified than an engineer to investigate this I don't expect a sociologist or a historian to understand development growth in math and things like that so this is what I do I studied reseearch this I'd almost go as far as saying sometimes the standard traditional degrees almost box your mind a little bit right sometimes not always right if you have a tendency to be boxed in with the constraints we have and uh very difficult for us to break those boxes and go outside so sometimes and Outsider perspective is quite interesting let's talk about astronomy and okay all right you know the science is a little more right right uh what would you like to say about it okay would you like to bring an astrology as well there is no such thing as astrology we only had joa we only had joa which is intricate observation of the Skies with mathematics understanding movement of the heavenly bodies and other such things Indians were intellectually so curious they have tried just about everything so even in astronomy they have tried to see how can I understand movements of the Heavenly skies and Peg it to life on Earth as the cosmos so in the microcosm also right they've tried ideas of this nature people are try to see Cycles in nature Cycles in life you know if we go through night and day cycles and things of that nature where is all this where is all this what do you mean like where have they written these things about uh whatever is up there is also down here it's this has been the recurrent theme throughout uh Indian uh writings and history if you will so throughout it has been that they look to the skies for inspiration and so also below over here as in the sky in the cosmos so over here this is a recurrent theme wherever you see this this is the kind of theme that happens and uh so so so if if you want to talk about Indian astronomy itself we have to go to pretty ancient times initially Indians obser observe the heavenly bodies all the movement of the heavenly bodies and so on and they tried to make sense of it they tried to remember it and they Evol that into stories they made a bunch of stories about it so encoding of wisdom into stories one such story early story was Chandra married the 27 Daughters of King Daka so that is a story that they made and promptly sent a whole lot of people tittering to laughter saying what nonsense Chandra is anthropomorphic the there's no such thing he's he's not a man and how can you marry 27 women but the point is it concealed a wisdom which people intended to convey every day our ancestors observed the moon would rise in the Eastern Horizon at a slightly different time and if it is evening time you can make out what is a star in the background right so if today it rises at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow it might rise at 8:40 right some sometime offset is over there and therefore it is against a different backdrop of stars every day and they notice it takes 27 days approximately for the moon to come back to the same backdrop of stars so they divided the entire ecliptic into 27 segments and it's not enough to just divide it right you should also recognize it so they tried to see what is the principal brightest star in each of these 27 segments and they gave it a name and pneumonic was the wives of the Moon by knowing the stories of the nakshatras I might be able to tell you what will follow what what follow what in other words you have an intricate and map of the Skies through Stories the stories tell you what's going to come next and so on so Indians could Mark the passage of time merely by looking at where is the moon against which backdrop of star is that each of these segments is called a nakshatra so it is presumed that Moon would visit one wife each day a lunar Mansion if you will like for example at 10:00 today if the moon is somewhere over there in the sky tomorrow at 10:00 you go and see where the Moon is it'll have fallen behind by 13 and 13° so this is the understanding in a 24-hour period it covers 13 and 13 degrees so this is what our ancestors did they initially observed these Cycles encoded them into stories so this is one such story the story says that Chandra loved rohini more than the others one of the wives and his father-in-law Daka got furious with him how can you treat my daughters unequally and so on he curses him you're going to die Chandra doesn't want to die he runs out to mahadeva please Maha I don't want to die mahadeva says I can't remove the curse but I'll alleviate it as you die eventually you'll grow in strength once again and once again you'll fade away and die so this part of the story is remembering the phases of the moon so the moon goes from Amasia to pami back to Amasia it takes 29.5 days approximately to do that so Indians clearly understood that we had a siderial month which is 27 days and nakhra based model and a 29.5 day codic month based on the Tity of the Moon and so on and they also understood utar and D it means the movement of the Moon northwards takes 6 months and the movement of the Moon southwards which takes another 6 months in this peregrination the moon goes from 23.3 De to the north all the way to- 23.3 de to the South when it goes to the southernmost point we have winter Soul s in the northern hemisphere so they understood the duration of the year in addition by looking at this phenomena and was 365.24 days so began intellectual developments in India do you know the books name or wherever all these records are kept these are for example in the puranas the matsa purana talks about Chandra marrying the 27 Daughters of King Daka about the story of mahadeva about F cursing all of these kind of things UT Dak stories come through for example there are stories that encode even this phenomena UT Dakine and so on that in various puranas we find these stories so uh they try to reconcile the various calendars that I have a solar uh 2 365.24 days I've got a codic month 29.5 days I've got a cidial month 27.3 days so they had to F figure out some synchrony between these things to make of it initially Riga said that the year consists of 360 days one might wonder what about the remaining 5.2 4 days well professor abank says that they used to have an airra sacrifice in the ancient days when they don't count the passage of time in those five days they do the yagya that time and it comes back into sink then later on in ATA itself it says the Rishi called rohita he created the adikam Masa adikam Masa is an interc calorie month which you insert into the calendar so that you'll have synchrony between the the the lunar and the solar calendar you have synchron every 2 three years you'll average out to 365.24 days and the ri called rohita was the one who mathematically figured out what was the way to do it so we have evidence of these kind of things Indians were great observers of the Skies trying to impose mathematics on it trying to get this intellectual fulfillment Me by trying to reconcile the Cycles all the yoga models that we have they have all intellectual outgrowths of the synchronizations that we talking about so all these things were done then we got in the Riga itself so much of astronomy various kinds of astronomy and one of them it is talking about the Rishi Atri Rishi Atri is supposed to have observed a solar eclipse you'll say big deal right I mean everybody observes solar eclipse why would you mention Rishi Atri over there but the fact is bakad tilak he translated what was then the Riga and he said that Atri made use of a device called Tura yantra a Tura yantra he translated to approximately a quadrant a quadrant is like a protractor right you measure angles with it and you might wonder what on Earth why would he use that right well we know that uh from at least from arata's work onwards if you take the plane of the sun called the ecliptic it appears the Sun is going around the earth right so that plane is called the ecliptic the path of the moon is offset by 5° as the pa the path of the Moon how the moon goes around the earth is offset by 5° the geometry I'm talking about the geometry now compared to the plane of the sun okay because of that eclipses can only happen when these two planes coincide on one side a solar eclipse can happen on the other side a lunar eclipse can happen and arabat has explained this beautifully and he's calling this as rahu and this as ketu so this whole business of rahu and ketu is explained by arabat using the mathematics showing when an eclipse can happen now if you want to predict an eclipse you've got to know the angle between Sun and Moon as that angle is coming closer and closer to zero You can predict an eclipse is going to happen so it looks like Rishi Atri had this device which is a tya yantra like a quadrant kind of device which obviously measures angles in the sky he's used that to predict when an eclipse would happen this is fantastic it's fantastic because today there are some who are saying Rashia 3's eclipse is dated to 4750 BCE some of says if that is not the one there's one more in 4202 BCE these are the kind of time frames that a three should be uh uh dated to on the eclipse information this means in that time frame this Rashi has all already understood there's an angular relationship between the Sun and the Moon based on which I can predict when an eclipse will happen so you have understood the phenomena you know how to measure it and you know how to predict it that is how he's Remembered in the Riga that Rishi Atri was able to predict the Sol I find this mindblowing that at such an early period of time Indians had understood the phenomena the mathematics predictive capability and things of this nature nature so this is not the only one ran there's so many instances in Indian astronomy that typically blows my mind I'll give you one example there is something called itria brahmana It's associated with the Riga and in itria brahmana in the second chapter there is a cryptic passage that passage says the sacrifice yagna had gone away from the devatas they did not know where it had gone to so they went to Aditi the mother of gods and she said can you help us can you help us find it she said sure I'll help you but I will choose a bone from you they said sure go ahead aoon aoon aoon yes they said sure go ahead and ask for it she said all sacrifices will begin and end with me very cryptic of passages which nobody understood what on Earth does it mean what does it mean yagya has gone away the dtas were unable to perform any sacrifice they were in total confusion they gone to Aditi and begged her Aditi saying sure I'll help you but the sacrifices will begin and end with me tilak was the one who recognized this he said this is an astronomical phenomena encoded here showing the great uh uh uh anxiety of our ancestors because they pegged everything into the celestial calendar they marked all festivals yagas everything based on the celestial clock over there right if that Celestial clock is out of work then I don't know what to do we will discuss why it will go out of work but if it does and it will then you don't know when to perform your cermony over a period of thousand years or so your calendars are going to slip because of something called axial Precision you mean the Earth's axis shifts the where the Earth Earth's axis of rotation right now if we are in uh Mumbai so it's around um um n 15° around 15° from The Horizon so it looks like Earth is rotating like this in Mumbai right around 15° so the where it is pointing to his Polaris that star appears to be immobile in the sky Earth is rotating from west to east therefore heavenly bodies are going east to west that's what is happening but where it is pointing to is slow SL tracing a path in the sky and this takes 26,000 years to complete okay 26,000 years to complete Earth's axis of rotation the Earth is wobbling it's wobbling okay it's like the analogy I give is like a top if you play to the top as a child you tie the string around the top and you twirl it the top spins very very fast but as it is spinning sometimes it's got a wobble right so Earth's fast spin is 24 hours the slow wobble is 26,000 years and it is doing this because of the gravitational impact of the sun moon and to a lesser extent Jupiter that is why Earth is wobbling like this at 26,000 years or so why is it important for us because we used siderial astronomy siderial meaning with respect to as nakshatra that is at a certain point what is the word nakshatra nakshatra remember I said that Indians divided the sky ecliptic in 27 segments and they identified a principal brightest star each segment they called each of that a nakshatra so we can identify that with the Stars today for example cria is ples and rohin alaran and ruti zap pisum like this we know we know what these stars are based upon what Indians did in the past so so so we had a perfect mapping of the Skies based on these kind of things these are called nakshatras so I said that Earth is processing 26,000 years and I said why is it important for us because we OB observed a phenomena based on what is a nakshatra at a cardinal point of astronomy what are the cardinal points of astronomy you've got the two Soul sesses Winter soulstice summer solce what does the word cardinal point mean these are the Cardinal means principal Point principal point when the when the Sun goes to the southernmost point that is a principal point it goes to the northernmost point that's a principal Point gotta in between it is going crossing the line the celestial equator and that is uh the Equinox position so these four points that point this point crossing the Equinox here when you returning Crossing these are the four cardinal points so Indians always observed what was a nakshatra at a cardinal point for example veral Equinox has always been New Year in India vernal equinox New Year point so they'll tell you what was a nakshatra at vernal equinox point for example a whole lot of literature says cria nakshatra was at the ver Equinox point that is no longer true today today it's not cria anymore so critica was the world Equinox in 2,400 BCE we know that today because of a planetarian software and things like that we can date these things so anyway what what what I'm saying is that this whole phenomena is because of precision that the calendar shifts when the calendar shifted the gods were unable to perform any yagya or any such thing they've gone to Aditi and said help us Aditi said all sacrifices will begin and end with me meaning ver Equinox will begin and end with me this is what adti was saying so we are now got to see when was The Equinox one Equinox at Aditi and what is Aditi in our nakshatra model in our nakshatra model we have a nakshatra called punarvasu punar vashu has got two stars in it diti and Aditi in the Greek tradition we call it caster and poock right wow caster and poock are diti and Aditi and collectively we call them punarvasu nakshatra if I want to find out when was punarvasu nakshatra at the veral linox point hold your breath I need to crank back in the astronomy software planetarium software to staggering 6,000 BCE that is 8,000 years ago was when our ancestors were thoroughly messed up in the Skies not knowing where when do I do my calendar implying that they had a calendar Thousand Years prior to that that was working because Precision Works in a few thousand years is when it gets messed up so it's got messed up to a point where they reset it to punarvasu or Aditi that is what is telling us what is the 26,000 year uh timeline then so this 26,000 years like I said this is amount of time it takes for the axis of rotation of the earth to trace this path in the sky and come back to we are pointing at a star called Polaris at The Other Extreme is a star called abijit or Vega Vega is a Greek name abijit is the Indian name it'll reach abijit in about 15,000 years from now 14,000 years from now then come back so that's the extent to which axis of rotation takes place and because of that the nakshatras which our ancestors observed they keep changing over time this is why I'm saying Indian astronomy is beautiful because we have got so so many astronomical phenomena in our text which clearly are not relevant today and we can use planetarian software and we can try to find out precisely when was something so here you are a date like 8,000 years ago Indians already had a notion of a calendar already had Notions of uh doing these kind of measurements I find that utterly fascinating let me give you one more amazing thing sure rir this is now the familiar story we all know right the Surya Surya our stories say the purana stories Ric stories that talk about this and say that Surya married sanjina and they had Yama yummy and marital bliss One Fine Day uh Surya got so brilliant so bright sanana could not take the heat so she abandons her husband and she goes off to the cooler region that's very important cooler region and uh before she leaves she leaves a shadow CH in her place One Fine Day Surya discovers a deception hey you're not my wife where's my wife and she says she's gone off to the cooler region so off Surya also goes to the cooler region to search for her he find she's taking the form of a mare a horse and he too takes the form of a horse and in that Union the ashni kumaras are born they the traditional Physicians healer physicians in India associated with horse and other such things they are born so simple enough story over here and like what what on Earth all these kind of uh people say ridiculous story and all this kind of things but for us there are several things to take away from here because there is a passage in Riga that says usas usas is a goddess of dawn okay she's appears at Dawn Goddess of dawn is usas usas awaken the ashis for their share of the Vic sacrifice such a passage is there in the Riga which you don't awaken a grown-up man you're awaken babies so and the point is that at dawn ashin are appearing over there which means along with the sun Ashwin must appear additionally we know because Surya went to the cooler region it should be winter soul in the northern hemisphere because it's gone to southernmost point which means we are looking for a phenomena when Ashwin are appearing at dawn and it is winter solce if you crank this back in time it turns out to be 7,200 BCE staggering amount of time right that is when you find that Ashwin appear with the Sun at winter solce point and they're Rising what was ashwin's astronomy wise astronomy wise there is a beta delin that's a western name so we can identify the stars I might be mistaken it's it's two stars basically it it is two stars twin stars twin stars and they tiny stars not very bright so I don't know why I'm getting goosebumbs but I'm getting but the punch line is not here the punch line is not in the Antiquity of 7,200 BC this was identified by again balag gangadhar tilak he identified it 100 years ago he's been talking about it and abanka also talked about it about 20 30 years ago why is no one talking about it in 2023 I'll tell you I've been talking about this for the last 10 years or so in my talks I've been talking about Ashwin you'll be shocked ranir two years back two papers came out in the Journal called nature in science nature right to two papers came about 2022 or 2021 I think 2022 that blew my mind again the reason is because I got an independent corroboration of what I'm telling you through scientific papers these papers two of them one of them said there was a solar flare that happened about 9,000 years ago precisely 7176 BCE I had dated to 7200 BC their date was 7176 BC see there was a massive solar flare that hit the earth and this solar flare was so big that the graphs in the paper shows completely out of whack let let me give you a backstory over here the normally we always you you know the the the sun has got 11e Sunspot Cycle right when sunspots go to a maximum you find a lot of them I mean you can take a telescope with a uh solar filter and you can see it easily you can see it and I have seen that right now we're going to a maximum again and two years back almost smooth you don't see any solar SP sunspots whenever we have sunspots there's a propensity for the sun to uh have a coronal mass ejection CME event that is when charged particles are thrown out of the sun right and if we are unlucky it comes through to towards the Earth normally we are okay because we got the magnetic lines of force and these are all charged particles so they conducted away to the North Pole South Pole by our magnetic lines and typically what happens is they interact in the upper atmosphere and there's all kind of isotopic activity that takes place radio activity takes place at the North Pole and South Pole that is why we get Aurora Borealis all the Northern Light Southern Lights are because of their activity and typically those radioactive particles rain down on the earth in these polar regions and they're preserved in the ice they preserved in the ice normally it is not a point for contention typically satellites are concerned with there'll be damage radio communication damage no biggy the biggest solar flare we have in recorded history goes back approximately I think 1856 or so it's called [[the Carrington]] event if you Google for Carrington event you'll find that this was such a big solar flare at that time that Earth was so ionized not only in the polar region normally see Aurora Borealis about a few latitudes to the north from the North Pole this Northern Light was seen up to Hawaii up to China That's How far these lights had come it was that powerful a storm not only that there were operators in the United States and Portland those days Telegraph lines did do Mor code so they were uh operating the T Telegraph L from Portland to Boston without turning on the power because the lines have become so ionized Telegraph lines are be so ionized the current flowing they're happily doing that Mor code this happened for 2 days over a period of 2 days the Earth was so ionized and this is the biggest event we know and people are saying in Australia people used to read newspapers at night without lights that's amount of light that you had with this event now with this as a backstory let us go back to this earlier event scientists are estimating this 7176 BC to be an order of magnitude bigger than carington event logarithmically 10 times larger and this they have found by drilling the ice course ice course in Antarctica ice course in Greenland they it's like a time capsule right the ice course you can take it to the lab slice uh s slice it little by little and you can study the Isotopes like berum and halflife of these things from the half life you can now estimate how far back in time these guys have drawn graphs in this nature paper off the charts suddenly in 7176 BC all these numbers are off the charts when I saw that I said my God this is exactly what I've been talking Indians remember sua became brilliant for a period of time probably the solar proton event was so great that it ionized the Earth so much anywhere you see you might have seen Brilliance it's like a haze that you see in in places right if you can imagine a bright Haze anywhere you look it might have been like that because sun was brighter B sun was brighter brighter hotter and it happened probably for a period of time maybe a few weeks uh and at a time I got to dial you back to the story who is the son's wife sanana sanj San San was the goddess of or was it just I don't remember she's the goddess but the story says that sanjana was surya's wife and because the son was so brilliant she leaves him and goes away to the cola region and he follows her over there I'm sorry my curiosity is making me want to Google who what sanana was the goddess of San because there there's got to be some metaphor in there as well precisely and sanj's father is vishak karma goddess of clouds and Twilight there you go so she clouds and Twilight went away from the Sun the Twilight left the sun right which means brilliant all the time brilliant no no protection no shade no protection so I I'll give you another uh like Hinduism angle to the story you know the chaa she left behind the shadow she left the son had a baby with that shadow and that baby is called Shani right right right yes yes which is Saturn Saturn Saturn yes makes me think that what was the shadow then or like why what like you know what was relevance Rel the relevance of the Shadow we we'll come back to that but let me finish this episode so after this when I saw this mindblowing story that is a perfect collaboration here I gave you 7,200 by reading the astronomy by looking at the astronomy we call the date to be precisely around 7200 BC plus and minus 80 years this side and that side that's when Ashwin are with heliacal Rising with the Sun at winter solce that is what the story has said that is what the rig the story has said we merely followed the formula and we have got this date and this date has been known to tilak for 100 100 years ago and for the last 10 years I've been uh popularizing this in my talks and so on two years ago this paper comes out and I say wo this is a complete collaboration of what I've been talking about about and another paper to came out the second paper said looking at the tree rings they're apparently able to get the tree ring records and they're saying there was a massive proton event exactly the same time 7176 BC so here you are 9,000 years ago whoever was living in India our ancestors have gone through a massive proton event and remembered that in a story yeah okay I got to pause you a little bit here and give some Millennial perspective reading a lot of and I remember reading about this exact story about and San all this all this stuff um I remember it was a family and even yamraaj is a part of that family I don't yes y Yami are part of the earlier family yes so yeah he's got I think with with sanjana he has kids and then with the yes yes yes Yama yummy with sanjana right Yama is the god of death yes yes and the story is amazing for one more reason Yama lymphs and yummy Shivers it could be a remembrance that when this uh radioactivity happened it's these are all cancer causing berum is massively cancer causing maybe it impacted the youth maybe youth were bedridden and so on and the story remembers yamama is limping not able to walk properly he a god of death in addition and yummy is shivering and this kind of a thing I'm just saying it's posible it's POS um I'll tell you my perspective I remember reading that story being very fascinated by all these amarata stories okay so I'm separating Mahabharat and ramayan from this because I in my heart believe that those events have also happened and those are actual human stories right things have happened in our past right but when it comes to these stories where we're talking about the son being married to the goddess of Twilight this was also written in amarata right and I remember my mom reading out the story to me from the comic book and then I asked her are these people are these aliens are these like some other higher beings and she didn't really have an answer and I remember my question mark just stopping there cut to 2023 and I've got my answer that these are celestial events yes encapsulated in Stories the stories traveled from 7,000 BC yes 9,000 years to pres 2001 when I read that amarata comic book right and this is one story right how many other stories are relaying how much of our past absolutely absolutely that's what I go around saying all the time that our stories are got so much metaphoric content if we have the key to unlock that wisdom we know what that wisdom is how far are we in unlocking these stories according to you like in terms of percentage very poor because we have a tendency today to have a pedestrian understanding only we dismissed this as myth right very negative word myth because we fail to see the metaphoric the philosophical wisdoms in these stories our first tendency is to say they are primitive people we are the most advanced of times and these are primitive people they don't realize that 9,000 years ago their ancestors had the same cranial capacity hey today you use an iPhone but that is no Mark of civilization or progress as such you're a blind user of an iPhone you don't know how it works what's behind it most people at least they don't know what what what is behind it so how does that make you technologically more advanced than that man over there he didn't have an iPhone but he wasn't perfectly in control of his nature and abstract thought and everything else so we should not attribute an early man has been primitive to a point where he was making stories like this these stories have woven intentionally intentionally they were done to encode knowledge if if I were to tell you for example R here's the theorem a theorem B learn this theorem learn that theorem the minute the class is over you're going to forget all about it I mean so dry and you can't take it but the minute I had have an infotainment over there I add a bit of entertainment see our RI understood our minds crave for entertainment even today one minute you're on Twitter one minute you're on Instagram one minute you're on Facebook one minute you're there because you want to be entertained all the time a shot here at this one there that one there and so on Rishi understood that and so they put entertainment over here along with the story metaphor over there so these stories like you correctly said they have passed on to us for 9,000 years and the still alive and they still speak to us all human needs is food shelter clothing and stories and stories entertainment you're a happy man if you have that um really makes me think about all the other celestial events events from ancient history events from prehistory that are actually tailored into Indian culture and even now you are right in saying a big section of the Indian population looks down upon this in urban India not so much in the interior of pedestrian understanding pedestrian understanding of these events so they dismiss it as myth it's a reflection of their ignorance rather than attempt to creatively intellectually decode what their ancestors meant um you know I'll tell you what questions are arising in my head I do kind of again want to talk about the younger D impact theory that we spoke about and then bring you to Vishnu puran about vishnu's first avar which was the matar and you know the other events in that Vishnu puran timeline when you actually study the 10 ofs Etc uh part of me now definitely believes that even if those stories didn't take place on Earth it's a metaphor used to describe celestial events true makes me wonder what that whole churning of The Ocean Story is right right right so yes I have I wondered about this churning of the ocean too but you talk to the dest event the younger dest event so let let's go to to that sure so we got the last glacial maximum approximately 22,000 to 18,000 years ago so you'll have to explain what a glacial maximum is okay okay okay so Earth has gone through ice ages yeah we know that there have been periods of ice ages periods of drought and you might wonder why is it happening well Milan kovich was a Serbian scientist in 1920s who linked this up with the uh uh movements of Earth in other words we know Earth is rotating we know that Earth is going around the sun no biggie we know that also in addition to that Earth is doing three more things one is it's orbit around the Sun is going from elliptical to slightly circular circular to Elliptical circular to elliptical and this is happening in a py period periodicity of about 100,000 years what that effectively means for non-mathematics grads is that Earth is going Clos and far from the Sun you can think of it yes yes but but not significantly but they say that yes yes but the thing is even enough just a little bit it will alter temperatures heavily exactly exactly exactly the second one it is doing is that axial Precision we talked about where the axis of rotation takes 26,000 years to complete that is the second one the third one is Earth's Tilt it goes from 21° to 24 uh Dees and this happens at 41,000 years so we got three additional Cycles now what is Earth's Tilt the the the Tilt we tilted now at 23° right our axis appears to be tilt as we going around the Sun it looks like see this tilt in my arm oh okay taking the North Pole and the South Pole as a reference yes yes it appears if you're tilted just like Uranus appears to be on its floor uh things like that so it appears to be going in his tilt and so on so we you you you have Earth's Tilt going from 21° to 24° and this happens at 41,000 years so three Cycles I talked about 100,000 years circular to Elliptical second one is the PR axial Precision 41 uh 26,000 years third one the Tilt this is around uh 41,000 years Milan kich did not discover these these things were seen by others his contribution is the addition of these three Cycles results in the amount of radiant energy the Earth gets from the Sun okay as in you put these figures into some mathematical formula you'll figure out how much of radiant energy is coming radiant energy means intense intensity of light yes the sunlight how much of sunlight we getting the each the northern Horizon the Northern Hemisphere southern hemisphere how much we getting and sunlight might be measured through the total quantity of photons the flux the amount of flux we're getting solar flux we getting there are other ways to do it but bottom line he said the ice ages and the drought periods of Earth are related to these three Cycles one of the most successful scientific theories to the present day because you go drill in the ice core in Greenland or Antarctica it fits the uh prediction so beautifully so we know that's true so we know through this these cycles that uh 22,000 to 18,000 years ago Earth went through an ice age and this ice age is called the last glacial maximum and this resulted in so much of water locked up in ice that the shorelines are visible far beyond where they are today I'm going to ask you a very rookie question here um have you seen the animated movie Ice Age M mhm you've seen it right love the squirrel yeah so you know exactly what I'm talking uh that's the reference point for two generations when it comes to the ice or I would go as far as saying four five generations know about the ice age from those animated films draw out a picture of the Ice Age for people who've not seen the animated movie uh in terms of what was the earth like then yes I would also go as far as saying what was the equatorial region around the earth like that right right right right right so so there's there is a diversity of opinions among geologists there is an unpopular opinion that Earth was an ice ball the whole earth was a slushy ice ball that that's a very unpopular opinion but there are some people who predict that but then some people estimate using the climate models that the the the ice the glacier the glaciers had come to a fairly large extent in India Himalayas maybe even beyond the Himalayas maybe up to New Delhi and others maybe we had ice ages over here what is a Glacier Glacier Glacier is the ice pack that we have that seems to grow over time if if if you have more of cooler periods it eventually keeps growing over time for example Gango three we have a glacier over there uh correct my science here okay my assumption is that when you totally lower the temperature of the earth which is what is happening in an ice AG gradually what ends up happening is a lot of the water vapor starts collecting and forming ice right that is how Glacier eventually yes yes so effectively Earth was also a lot taller right yeah I guess I could say that ice pack was growing as think there was a layer of ice That Grew around the earth right right right my assumption has always been that in a place as hot as say Tamil Nadu can have been to Tamil Nadu and you need to experience the heat in Tamil Nadu in the summer to really understand how hot India can get uh yes even that part had like I said unpopular opinion some people say even in the equatorial region we had ice that's a minority there's a book there called snowball Earth where the geologist is discussing why he thinks that was the case but then this we are talking about the last glacial maximum that is not as severe as earlier ice ages earlier Ice Ages were even more severe so this was not that severe this this particular I we're talking about and what is the frequency of them like I said the three Cycles right the the the the excentricity cycle Precision Cycle tilt cycle by adding the impact of those three things people can predict when they will come so there is are they at equal no no it's random a because of the cycle it's a it's when the periodicity is resonate right the resonance has got to build up because sometimes you could be out of phase if you're out of phase then the impact is not much but when all three add up with resonance resonances between them that's when you'll have an impact either cold impact or a heat impact one of the two things so over millions of years you're able to predict this phase will be an ice AG in this pH right precisely and there are also warming periods and Cooling precisely all are can be predicted with these kind of cycles and we're currently in a warming period that's what we have found yes we are in the family hockey sck kind of Rise yes we're in a warming period right now and we're making it wayers because of using fossil fuels human activities this there are there are people who are politically tone by this whole thing some people saying it's a natural consequence of Earth Cycles whereas others are saying it has accelerated since the Industrial Revolution because of human activity so we in the holos scene Extinction event right now this is almost a controversial conversation you know like I know how controversial this conversation can get uh I'm all for the environment I strongly believe that our actions are causing a lot of harm to environment it's visible to the human eye if you go out in my balcony Now versus even 2 years ago there's so much more Haze there's so much more smoke of course we are damaging the environment right like as Joe rud said who is the former England cricket team captain he said that when I was playing in it felt like I was eating the air man so there's no way that our actions are not adding to global warming according to me true very true there's a paper that came out from scientist 15,000 scientists in 2017 or 18 they gave a two-page paper with only graphs in each craft the depletion of the forest cover and the dead zones in the sea where there's no life in the sea and the forest cover ozone pack like this they had about 15 to 20 indicators every one of them is down every one of them showing indicators going down and they had promoted that it's urgent we should go to a plant-based diet the sooner we do that the better for the environment obviously reducing fertility also that was a recommendation also when you pinch and poke and punch Mother Nature this much it's going to pinch and poke and punch you back at some point the gear model Earth is alive and she will respond in a way to do that and you feel it you see in the V the concept everything has got Consciousness everything is part of Brahman if everything is part of Brahman there is some amount of Consciousness here here and maybe a growing amount of Consciousness as you go to humans and so on self-awareness and Consciousness so this is part of who we think we are there is consciousness everywhere including the Earth and yes there will be a reaction eventually but we are digressing from the last glacial maximum let's talk about the I say good sir last glacial maximum I I just think you know know these warming be cooling be narratives are important to understand the ice AG better precisely yes yes yes indeed indeed so 18 24,000 22,000 to 18,000 years ago we had this maximum of this last glacial maximum meaning most of the water was locked up in ice and it estimated that the sea levels were 125 M lower than where they are today that's approximately 400 ft can you imagine 125 M lower that's where the water level was that means continents were larger right right and now is a fascinating thing there's a professor called ramaswami SM ramaswami in bhatti dasan University in trishna he published a paper two or three years back saying that he had used remotely operated vehicles and sonar in the Bay of Bengal not just anywhere but he was wanting to find out what is below on the Bay of Bengal 15 km outside the present Shoreline 125 M below he has found man-made structures there uh did they date it yes well well well he's taken many radio samples but I'm telling you from last glacial maximum when could it have been possible that humans were living 125 M below the sea right this is only possible during the last glacial maximum and all over the world sea level was lower by 125 M and he's reporting he's taking pictures can see his paper where there is looks to be a man-made Harbor that is fascinating why would people need Harbor 18,000 years ago who were they trading with what were they trading with what kind of ships were they no iron what were they how were they building these things explain this point further the reverse of this is dwara getting engulfed by the SE I will come to that I will come to that I will come to that so uh Professor ramaswami he's saying he's got a lot of artifacts taken carbon dating I think the results of are not published yet but he thinks that these are going back around 18,000 years he's saying the shape of the harbor seems to be a technology that has moved northwards he's saying daka's shape of the harbor and everything seems to be similar to what he's found here I didn't understand so so he's saying the harbor shape and other such things seem to be similar here and in dwara but dwara now later dated by more than thousand 10,000 years later right I also just want to mention about dka to our listeners we had someone from uh the special forces of the Navy of the Indian Navy it's called the Marcos right whose job was to dive deep and investigate dwarka so this has been found by the Marcos of the Indian military Wonder uh anyway now go on so my my understanding of um well let let me finish bti das's University work so they have found man-made Harbors over there clearly showing to us that human activity was there in the coast regions in India in a very ancient period of time and we have evidence of coastal civilizations not only in this is the puhar not today's puhar but 18,000 years ago that could have been puhar and on dwaraka again we we know from mahabarata that after Arjuna got the yadava women out turns around and Daka sunk under the sea we know that in 2003 there was National Institute of oceanography from Chennai they sent a ship with sonar equipment and things like that to Gulf of cambay because they wanted to lay an internet submarine line so they're mapping the ocean floor in the process of mapping in that paper they have reported that they found a uh 9 kilm wall uh long uh structure that seems to be like a sea wall it's it they said it looks man-made a lot of controversy on that saying a natural or not but it looks like a seaw wall running for 9 km they dredged up a piece of vot carbon dated in Germany Hanover as well as in Hyderabad and they came with a date of around 9,000 years before present for that piece of vot promptly the people saying big deal so what and those kind of things but uh uh there are associations with perhaps dwaraka and I don't fully buy it because my belief is dwaraka is around 150 km out uh from from where they were looking if if you look at B dwara where it is and where uh uh today's dwaraka is my belief is it it's off over there there's some reasons why I think so and I forgotten entirely how to argue that but I wrote it down at some point so it's out in the sea anyway we are finding artifacts we finding artifacts in coastal civilizations here's a fascinating part um R we have stories that talk about uh uh in in in Tamil Nadu in in in Tamil people have got memories of a suum period a suum period that lasted about 10,000 years ago they think there were three s suum periods are literary periods they believe that three suum periods the earliest one was almost 10,000 years ago it happened in a place they called Ten madur Ten mad means Southern madurai okay some some place over there second period was another 3,000 years a literary period Then they believe that the entire thing was submerged and this is written in it is the cultural memory of the Tamil people so many people have memory of this going to the past and talking about this and this entire M mad was submerged and the third literary period took place in the present Maday which is Northern Maday literally so Tamil people pres preserve a memory of lands that have been lost the Tamil nationalists promptly said Kumari kandam that is stretching from Madagascar to Australia to India I don't think that is true because you have to give context to okay okay so in uh uh uh um late 1900s no no no early 1900s when people did not know what plate tectonics plate tectonics are the ones that matter for Continental shaping and those kind of things the Western scientists were interested in knowing why do we have the same fossel in different continents the limur are popular in uh Madagascar but what are the limor doing in India how is that possible so they presumed that it was a land bridge through which these things had come about and the Tamil nationalists promptly said that they must have been uh land connected from Madagascar to Southern India to Australia and that's remembered the suum period land submerged I don't think that is true because I've looked through Google Earth if you can go to Google Earth and look at the depth of the water just outside continental shelf of shelf of India the depth dep Falls of 3 km 2 km 5 km there's no way we had land even during the last glacial maximum last glacial maximum is our reference because water level was 125 M below right so any land is 125 M and above is candidates for the submerged land that tumil memory is there and that does not extend to continent wide but it extends about 90 km from the present Shoreline 90 km from the present Shor line we had land and so tumil memories preserving that there were Coastal civilizations here there that is all sunken during the Earth warming up ice ages going up and rather water levels going up just like how where we are sitting Mumbai probably going be underwater in 200 years easily possible very possible and I I think that's a prediction in fact you don't have to wait that long if the predictions are right it could happen at 2050 in 2050 we could have water levels chenai could be submer mered Kolkata and Bangladesh many places could be submerged uh this side Mumbai also could suffer a lot of submergence events and Florida in the US that could suffer submergence events so people are predicting that I mean given that they said the Doomsday scenario is if the average temperature of the earth goes up by 1.5° compared to Industrial Revolution guess what in 2023 we broke the record many times all over the world we broke this record of 1.5 average uh ctim Centigrade we broke it many times if this is a recurring event into the future I think we're in for some pretty bad weather apocalyptic floods precisely precisely it could could very much happen I mean you know if we truly open eyes apocalyptic natural events are already happening around us right but we're just oblivious or we're just escaping it we we don't make the connections we live in the moment but we don't have memory to connect the events and have a dynamical picture I don't remember so many floods so many storms so many earthquakes happening this frequently when I was a child maybe earthquakes I'll separate from that argument but at least when we're talking about flash floods whatever is happening in the Himalayas this is nature biting back we just need to open our eyes and notice right right right um anyway so you asked me what is my notion of History all this was my deep history early on you asked me what is a deep history and I said it goes back so much of time now I'm talking 18,000 years ago we had people living here and we got cultural memory the south of lands that have been lost the Lost lands would have been around uh the the the late GL one more Ice Age mini ice age called late glacial maximum the last glacial is TW 22 to 18,000 years ago the late glci is around 12,000 years younger D period yes that's a younger D because I believe uh I don't know the exact science behind this but um basically when that meteor hit Earth around 12,000 years ago um it created a massive dust cloud in the air right it's as if you're shooting a bullet into a big ball of sand mhm the dust cloud stayed blocked off sunlight the lack of sunlight cooled down the Earth heavily right for a long time right uh and this is what Randall Carlson's research is also based on he spoke about studying the effect of the glaciers from this period on the geography of North America which is very close to where the impact happened apparently happened in the Gulf of Mexico so he he's done multiple podcasts of Jo Rogan talking about how they've tracked the movement of the glaciers in North America very interesting very interesting when did we last see something like this in the Indian context in the Indian context now brace yourself 74,000 years ago hasn't 74,000 what did we see we had a mount TOA an event a super volcano in Sumatra referred to as Mount TOA Indonesia Indonesia this this was so big and was aimed towards India it put so much of particulate matter in the earth that India and Pakistan were covered by 5 m of Ash can you imagine this 5 m of Ash even today if you go to jalapur jalapur is in Carol District in Andra Pradesh there's a researcher called Ravi kis he's published some works on this he has discovered the ash layer from the 75,000 years ago he's found human artifacts below the ash layer then the ashayer human artifacts above the ashayer showing India was populated before this event and after but 5 m of Ash five M of Ash like my engineering hostel room anyway go on but the point is that it put so much of particulate matter it caused an instant six-year nuclear winter it caused a many thousand what is a nuclear winter nuclear winter yes so this is the concept that we have in um in our apocalyptic view if you have a nuclear explosions and things of that nature there'll be so much of matter in the in the air the dust and other such things floating around the earth and so on prevents the sunlight from coming in cooling down it's a happening over there but this caused a Thousand-Year uh winter over here and they estimate that the breeding adults fell to 10,000 what the number of adults who are alive after the event all over the Earth all over the in in India because all the see in this empty DNA studies they presume that all the non-african people of the world have originated in India through two linages called M and N markers and so what I'm telling you now is related to that after this Mount Toba event happened 74,000 years ago they estimate less than 10,000 adults were there on Earth on on on this region from whom we have all come if this theory is right you and I are alive because one of our ancestors are there yeah who survived that event it's not just you and me but it's also Cristiano Ronaldo everybody way roone everybody uh Lebron not LeBron James because technically he's of African desent according to this according to this theory yes all the non-african populations have come from these these people okay so amazing Theory but but we are seeing this what you said is about the scrandle theory about uh we seeing this again and again katua katua was a massive volcano that happened Sumatra uh 1800s I'm not mistaken 1880 or something like that that also put so much of particulate matter in the skies and we have had problems 600 current ERA one more massive volcano happened and I'm trying to link that up with u uh what happened in India we had droughts over here and can we see that regimes have changed the chalukyas came at that time there were other powers that faded away Powers there for Thousand Years suddenly fading away and a new power coming over there without a war or any such thing the only thing is that there must have been so much of unrest and problems with no crops growing because of nuclear kind of winter kind of do you think there's anything mentioned about this 75,000 year old um ice age that we spoke about the Sumatra explosion so so if there is we have not yet found it we not decoded it there's so much in our Vic literature including the vas themselves there so much over there that these are all metaphoric content nobody can take the vas and do a word for word translation and hope to get meaning out of it not going to happen there's a lot to be decoded in the vas precisely precis it's got to be interpreted and the question is what is it what is it encoding what is it information encoded over there we have no idea some of it so but I believe an event of this magnitude would have been remembered through uh time and maybe somewhere an echo of it would be there okay so we've almost reached the end of this conversation sir good good um you know what I will definitely say is that I adore talking to archaeologists as well but for different reasons as I said at the start of the episode often I feel like professions and professional guidelines make you think within a certain boundary which is important for that craft right uh because archaeologists the job that they do is they go into the field with an open mindset they'll search for evidence first and foremost so the methodology is important what kind of methodology they follow they got to follow the prescriptions in that field right so the conversations I end up having with them are very different sometimes it's about the texture of the things that they find Weg the the only issue with that is that it limits room for conversations about thought experiments so many of the conversations we've had today I won't say are exactly thought experiments but it's a more expansive thought right based on Ancient scripture perhaps my last question on this entire show for you would be another thought experiment M related to the younger D impact Theory okay now that was supposedly a very important cataclysmic event in the history absolutely of the earth yes I remember Joe Rogan and Randle Carlson both saying that even that reduced the human population heavily it was almost like a reboot of civilization so let's Place ourselves in a situation where a meteor is about to hit the Earth right now we have cameras we have mics we have electricity we have the internet right people take the internet for granted the internet is a series of vires under the Earth absolutely yes even that's going to get wrecked because of meteor hitting the O right our technology is going to get wrecked lots of people that we know around us are going to die right the human population will be reduced mhm it'll be apocalyptic there will be a nuclear winter mhm it'll be exactly like those apocalyptic movies that you see right and when you have kids say you survive M you'll have to learn survival skills in the same way that Bear Grills does on his show Etc true you'll begin from a bit a little bit of a hunter gatherer mindset that's what your life will become if there's truly an apocalyptic event right right now we know for a fact that the apocalyptic event happened in 10,000 BC roughly around the time frame yeah uh the effects of it were there for a while after that we had to restart civilization that is my theory against the archaeologists that claim that because the indust valley civilization was not that Advanced okay that's what the theory is that the kind of art that we see the kind of architecture that we see um they weren't capable of the televisions that we hear about in the Mahabharat the aeroplanes that we hear about in the ramayan right right that's the theory that we have proof about the IND civilization my angle on this is that even if technology advanced a lot before 10,000 BC it was all crushed to nothing because of the younger Dr impact and then we to restart from there and what we see in the indust valley civilization is 8,000 years roughly post the younger D impact uh so we had to rebuild that's why yes you know I know the indust civilization had that whole drainage system it had governance and all that and there's still so much we don't understand about it right but it was a reboot of Indian civilization we are taught that it was the beginning of the Indian civilization right uh do you have anything to say about absolutely so many thoughts some are speculative some we have uh evidence or we have uh informed opinions on some things for example remember I told you the Carrington event 1856 or so such a big solar flare is known to have hit the earth they say if that magnitude flare hit the Earth today life would stop existing the way you understand it for at least 2 years it says every telephone line every sorry every Power Line would be gone Transformers would have exploded and so you have no electricity anywhere in the world and all your satellites will be gone all your communication will be gone all your beautiful internet streaming Netflix everything gone and you wouldn't have this it'll take the Earth 2 years to recover that's the amount of time it'll take to ramp up the factories again get the Transformers again repair power all over the world so you can imagine that kind of Apocalypse is not only because of meteor the sun can easily do it to you easily do it we can't predict that right we can't we can't predict that this happened we know this big event happened in 1800s it could happen anytime anytime it could have a huge solar flare and modern technological Life as we understand it today would would have gone with that is that in mind I often tell people think about this Western Europe was a backward Primitive Place for a long time after they adopted Christianity in Constantine Christianity 330 current ER they checked out all the Greek knowledge Greek philosophy which was all India looking right vant looking they chucked them out as pagans and they became a theocracy a church theocracy where they had Orthodoxy over there feudal kind of government you're not allowed to think right you had to be a a sheep follow the shepherd kind of a thing they had this going till 1500 1500 they have if you see my talks you'll understand how they're ramped up on Knowledge from India and all this kind of things and they were primed for the so-called Renaissance right they primed for that and the so-called age of rationalism and things like that when they started learning things from Indian knowledge I often tell people as a thought experiment these guys who didn't even have place value uh addition subtraction multiplication they learned only, 1550 from India from the time of newon in 1600 still today they managed to go from nothing to sending a spaceship to Jupiter to Mars and other such places so 600 years that is all it took from zero to understanding burnell's principle of lift to building W Brothers aircraft to building these huge rockets that can have enough impulse to take you out out of space and things like that 600 years I ask the question often how many 600 years Cycles do we have in the past where maybe not pervasively like we know today but maybe in some aspect of Technology where you went to Great Heights and lost it all of course rational thinking person will ask where are the artifacts I want to find a fossil I want to find a remain and intriguingly time to time we find these things one of them is the antia the antia was a mechanism found in early 1900s of the seas in Greece Mediterranean Sea they found it intricate hearing mechanism we know that because we can x-ray this and find out intricate mechanism that seems to be some kind of a Celestial clock it shouldn't belong to that period that kind of mechanism and that kind of computation should not belong to that period of time but it is there so like this time to time we find something says wo what is this for example the so-called austia battery where uh uh uh descriptions are given on how we can make a electrolyte and have some kind of insulator and there's a potential difference and you can make a current out of that doesn't belong to a period if we believe in linear growth of science but it is there so I often ask a question how many 600 period Cycles do we have going back 10,000 years 20,000 years yeah very POS so I I'm open to this I have not closed my mind to this I think one of the things I would like to teach my own children about history is about the impact of nature on History this is one thing I've learned as a very macro lesson on the show we've had an archaeologist Dr prakar who's actually explored the pyramids as well even inside the pyramids they found a battery and spoken about it I I've heard about this yes so and this is a qualified archaeologist uh speaking you know my point is that even the ancient Egyptians didn't believe that they were the ancient Egyptians they felt they were the modern Egyptians and the ancient Egyptian culture was from almost a LH years ago this is the kind of History I'd want to tell my children about not just the history that we read in our history textbooks and with that sir that's the episode for today it's wonderful it's been excellent discussion and ranir thank you for inviting me it's been a pleasure talking all these subjects pleasure speaking to you sir I want the Indian narrative on this I hate calling it alternative history because it's not it's not deep history deep history that's the word deep history it's not prehistory it's not Proto history it is deep history we're talking about uh history that's studied with more of an open mind right uh of course there's room for error Even in our conversations we're doing many thought experiments in our conversations but this is the exact kind of conversation that leads to archaeological findings you have to be suggestive at least while you're talking about it's what could have been it's like I say if you break these chains of 1500 BC in Invasion and throw them away the shackles are out of your mind then this is what I meant so many many things are there in the Indian context we can reconcile them without any problem to the ancient past like for example we talked about science 8,000 BC 9,000 BC well we got carbon dating from sarasti synu civilization birana the oldest dates are 9,000 years before present happy reconciliation of uh astronomy and radiocarbon dating but anyway it's been a pleasure talking all these things with you R Raj vam sir love how much of a deep history n you are just like myself it's just two nerdy engineering Brads abely breaking down some deep history nerds nerds that's who we are yeah that's the key to life and happiness and love sometimes I don't know why I said that thank you for being on the show sir appreciate you appreciate your time thank you that was the episode for today and this is exactly the kind of conversation I crave both in life and on TRS we're always looking for guest recommendations from you guys I know how much you'll enjoy these historical and cultural conversations tell me what you thought about this conversation as well and please do send in some epic guest recommendations DRS will be back soon two episodes are releasing every week and the knowledge download ladies and gentlemen has only just begun we'll see you very very [Music] soon [Music] oh the special forces of the Navy of the Indian Navy it's called the Marcos whose job was to dive deep and investigate dwarka this was identified by Baka 100 years ago he's been talking about it daka's shape of the harbor and everything seems to be similar to what he's found here 22,000 to 18,000 years ago Earth went through an ice Ag and this ice AG is called last glacial maximum and this resulted in so much of water locked up in ice that the shorelines are visible far beyond where they are today draw out a picture of the Ice Age for people who've not seen the animated movie earlier Ice Ages were even more s even beyond the Himalayas maybe up to New Delhi and others maybe we had ice ages over here in 2050 we could have water levels Chennai could be submerged Kolkata and Bangladesh many places could be submerged Mumbai also could suffer a lot of submer livs would you like to bring in astrology there is no such thing as astrology we only had joa Indians could Mark the passage of time mely by looking at where is the move against which backdrop of star is that this is fantastic I don't know why I'm getting Goosebumps but I'm getting Goosebumps and I remember my mom reading out the story to me from the comic book and then I asked her are these people are these aliens and she didn't really have an answer and I remember my question mark just stopping there cut to 2023 and I've got my answer that these are celestial events encapsulated in Stories the stories traveled from 7,000 BC yes 9,000 years to present 2001 when I read that at her comic book and this is one story how many other stories are relaying how much of our past absolutely these stories areen intentionally to encode knowledge there's a lot to be decoded in the wayas precisely done so many episodes on Indian history on Indian culture on what people call mythology which is an offensive word for so many Indians this particular podcast contains all of these topics and much more because it's centered around astronomy as well the science of our solar system system how our solar system is linked to Indian culture how our ancients discovered secrets about astronomy if you're someone who enjoys all these cultural conversations you're going to enjoy this one but trust me I feel every Indian should watch this podcast because this is the true deep history of our land the ancient history of our land before 10,000 BC lots of different topics have been addressed in this one had a lot of fun recording this I'm sure you're going to have a lot of fun listening to this special conversation with Raj [Music] vam how are you Raj vam sir I'm very fine thank you ranir it's a real pleasure to be here it's a privilege too to be on your show so thank you for inviting me appreciate your presence here sir um you do a bunch of things that's what I find the most fascinating about you uh began as an engineer you did your doctorate now you've kind of dedicated your life to unearthing the hidden history of India uh there's a lot of people who have heard this first sentence itself and switched off because according to a lot of people you need to be a historian to be able to talk about this after doing more than like 550 episodes I've realized that knowledge is gained when there's curiosity for the knowledge to be gained and as long as you're following the techniques that historians follow um you're doing a just job but of course there will be people who will switch off anyway so this podcast is for everyone else who's willing to be open who's willing to learn outstanding outstanding see there's a tendency to be for people to be gatekeeping gatekeeping in the sense that how are you credential to do this kind of thing often I tell them I'm an engineer I'm interested in knowing what were the contributions of my ancestors to some Science and Technology who else is better qualified than an engineer to investigate this I don't expect a sociologist or a historian to understand development growth in math and things like that so this is what I do I studied reseearch this I'd almost go as far as saying sometimes the standard traditional degrees almost box your mind a little bit right sometimes not always right if you have a tendency to be boxed in with the constraints we have and uh very difficult for us to break those boxes and go outside so sometimes and Outsider perspective is quite interesting let's talk about astronomy and okay all right you know the science is a little more right right uh what would you like to say about it okay would you like to bring an astrology as well there is no such thing as astrology we only had joa we only had joa which is intricate observation of the Skies with mathematics understanding movement of the heavenly bodies and other such things Indians were intellectually so curious they have tried just about everything so even in astronomy they have tried to see how can I understand movements of the Heavenly skies and Peg it to life on Earth as the cosmos so in the microcosm also right they've tried ideas of this nature people are try to see Cycles in nature Cycles in life you know if we go through night and day cycles and things of that nature where is all this where is all this what do you mean like where have they written these things about uh whatever is up there is also down here it's this has been the recurrent theme throughout uh Indian uh writings and history if you will so throughout it has been that they look to the skies for inspiration and so also below over here as in the sky in the cosmos so over here this is a recurrent theme wherever you see this this is the kind of theme that happens and uh so so so if if you want to talk about Indian astronomy itself we have to go to pretty ancient times initially Indians obser observe the heavenly bodies all the movement of the heavenly bodies and so on and they tried to make sense of it they tried to remember it and they Evol that into stories they made a bunch of stories about it so encoding of wisdom into stories one such story early story was Chandra married the 27 Daughters of King Daka so that is a story that they made and promptly sent a whole lot of people tittering to laughter saying what nonsense Chandra is anthropomorphic the there's no such thing he's he's not a man and how can you marry 27 women but the point is it concealed a wisdom which people intended to convey every day our ancestors observed the moon would rise in the Eastern Horizon at a slightly different time and if it is evening time you can make out what is a star in the background right so if today it rises at 8:00 p.m. tomorrow it might rise at 8:40 right some sometime offset is over there and therefore it is against a different backdrop of stars every day and they notice it takes 27 days approximately for the moon to come back to the same backdrop of stars so they divided the entire ecliptic into 27 segments and it's not enough to just divide it right you should also recognize it so they tried to see what is the principal brightest star in each of these 27 segments and they gave it a name and pneumonic was the wives of the Moon by knowing the stories of the nakshatras I might be able to tell you what will follow what what follow what in other words you have an intricate and map of the Skies through Stories the stories tell you what's going to come next and so on so Indians could Mark the passage of time merely by looking at where is the moon against which backdrop of star is that each of these segments is called a nakshatra so it is presumed that Moon would visit one wife each day a lunar Mansion if you will like for example at 10:00 today if the moon is somewhere over there in the sky tomorrow at 10:00 you go and see where the Moon is it'll have fallen behind by 13 and 13° so this is the understanding in a 24-hour period it covers 13 and 13 degrees so this is what our ancestors did they initially observed these Cycles encoded them into stories so this is one such story the story says that Chandra loved rohini more than the others one of the wives and his father-in-law Daka got furious with him how can you treat my daughters unequally and so on he curses him you're going to die Chandra doesn't want to die he runs out to mahadeva please Maha I don't want to die mahadeva says I can't remove the curse but I'll alleviate it as you die eventually you'll grow in strength once again and once again you'll fade away and die so this part of the story is remembering the phases of the moon so the moon goes from Amasia to pami back to Amasia it takes 29.5 days approximately to do that so Indians clearly understood that we had a siderial month which is 27 days and nakhra based model and a 29.5 day codic month based on the Tity of the Moon and so on and they also understood utar and D it means the movement of the Moon northwards takes 6 months and the movement of the Moon southwards which takes another 6 months in this peregrination the moon goes from 23.3 De to the north all the way to- 23.3 de to the South when it goes to the southernmost point we have winter Soul s in the northern hemisphere so they understood the duration of the year in addition by looking at this phenomena and was 365.24 days so began intellectual developments in India do you know the books name or wherever all these records are kept these are for example in the puranas the matsa purana talks about Chandra marrying the 27 Daughters of King Daka about the story of mahadeva about F cursing all of these kind of things UT Dak stories come through for example there are stories that encode even this phenomena UT Dakine and so on that in various puranas we find these stories so uh they try to reconcile the various calendars that I have a solar uh 2 365.24 days I've got a codic month 29.5 days I've got a cidial month 27.3 days so they had to F figure out some synchrony between these things to make of it initially Riga said that the year consists of 360 days one might wonder what about the remaining 5.2 4 days well professor abank says that they used to have an airra sacrifice in the ancient days when they don't count the passage of time in those five days they do the yagya that time and it comes back into sink then later on in ATA itself it says the Rishi called rohita he created the adikam Masa adikam Masa is an interc calorie month which you insert into the calendar so that you'll have synchrony between the the the lunar and the solar calendar you have synchron every 2 three years you'll average out to 365.24 days and the ri called rohita was the one who mathematically figured out what was the way to do it so we have evidence of these kind of things Indians were great observers of the Skies trying to impose mathematics on it trying to get this intellectual fulfillment Me by trying to reconcile the Cycles all the yoga models that we have they have all intellectual outgrowths of the synchronizations that we talking about so all these things were done then we got in the Riga itself so much of astronomy various kinds of astronomy and one of them it is talking about the Rishi Atri Rishi Atri is supposed to have observed a solar eclipse you'll say big deal right I mean everybody observes solar eclipse why would you mention Rishi Atri over there but the fact is bakad tilak he translated what was then the Riga and he said that Atri made use of a device called Tura yantra a Tura yantra he translated to approximately a quadrant a quadrant is like a protractor right you measure angles with it and you might wonder what on Earth why would he use that right well we know that uh from at least from arata's work onwards if you take the plane of the sun called the ecliptic it appears the Sun is going around the earth right so that plane is called the ecliptic the path of the moon is offset by 5° as the pa the path of the Moon how the moon goes around the earth is offset by 5° the geometry I'm talking about the geometry now compared to the plane of the sun okay because of that eclipses can only happen when these two planes coincide on one side a solar eclipse can happen on the other side a lunar eclipse can happen and arabat has explained this beautifully and he's calling this as rahu and this as ketu so this whole business of rahu and ketu is explained by arabat using the mathematics showing when an eclipse can happen now if you want to predict an eclipse you've got to know the angle between Sun and Moon as that angle is coming closer and closer to zero You can predict an eclipse is going to happen so it looks like Rishi Atri had this device which is a tya yantra like a quadrant kind of device which obviously measures angles in the sky he's used that to predict when an eclipse would happen this is fantastic it's fantastic because today there are some who are saying Rashia 3's eclipse is dated to 4750 BCE some of says if that is not the one there's one more in 4202 BCE these are the kind of time frames that a three should be uh uh dated to on the eclipse information this means in that time frame this Rashi has all already understood there's an angular relationship between the Sun and the Moon based on which I can predict when an eclipse will happen so you have understood the phenomena you know how to measure it and you know how to predict it that is how he's Remembered in the Riga that Rishi Atri was able to predict the Sol I find this mindblowing that at such an early period of time Indians had understood the phenomena the mathematics predictive capability and things of this nature nature so this is not the only one ran there's so many instances in Indian astronomy that typically blows my mind I'll give you one example there is something called itria brahmana It's associated with the Riga and in itria brahmana in the second chapter there is a cryptic passage that passage says the sacrifice yagna had gone away from the devatas they did not know where it had gone to so they went to Aditi the mother of gods and she said can you help us can you help us find it she said sure I'll help you but I will choose a bone from you they said sure go ahead aoon aoon aoon yes they said sure go ahead and ask for it she said all sacrifices will begin and end with me very cryptic of passages which nobody understood what on Earth does it mean what does it mean yagya has gone away the dtas were unable to perform any sacrifice they were in total confusion they gone to Aditi and begged her Aditi saying sure I'll help you but the sacrifices will begin and end with me tilak was the one who recognized this he said this is an astronomical phenomena encoded here showing the great uh uh uh anxiety of our ancestors because they pegged everything into the celestial calendar they marked all festivals yagas everything based on the celestial clock over there right if that Celestial clock is out of work then I don't know what to do we will discuss why it will go out of work but if it does and it will then you don't know when to perform your cermony over a period of thousand years or so your calendars are going to slip because of something called axial Precision you mean the Earth's axis shifts the where the Earth Earth's axis of rotation right now if we are in uh Mumbai so it's around um um n 15° around 15° from The Horizon so it looks like Earth is rotating like this in Mumbai right around 15° so the where it is pointing to his Polaris that star appears to be immobile in the sky Earth is rotating from west to east therefore heavenly bodies are going east to west that's what is happening but where it is pointing to is slow SL tracing a path in the sky and this takes 26,000 years to complete okay 26,000 years to complete Earth's axis of rotation the Earth is wobbling it's wobbling okay it's like the analogy I give is like a top if you play to the top as a child you tie the string around the top and you twirl it the top spins very very fast but as it is spinning sometimes it's got a wobble right so Earth's fast spin is 24 hours the slow wobble is 26,000 years and it is doing this because of the gravitational impact of the sun moon and to a lesser extent Jupiter that is why Earth is wobbling like this at 26,000 years or so why is it important for us because we used siderial astronomy siderial meaning with respect to as nakshatra that is at a certain point what is the word nakshatra nakshatra remember I said that Indians divided the sky ecliptic in 27 segments and they identified a principal brightest star each segment they called each of that a nakshatra so we can identify that with the Stars today for example cria is ples and rohin alaran and ruti zap pisum like this we know we know what these stars are based upon what Indians did in the past so so so we had a perfect mapping of the Skies based on these kind of things these are called nakshatras so I said that Earth is processing 26,000 years and I said why is it important for us because we OB observed a phenomena based on what is a nakshatra at a cardinal point of astronomy what are the cardinal points of astronomy you've got the two Soul sesses Winter soulstice summer solce what does the word cardinal point mean these are the Cardinal means principal Point principal point when the when the Sun goes to the southernmost point that is a principal point it goes to the northernmost point that's a principal Point gotta in between it is going crossing the line the celestial equator and that is uh the Equinox position so these four points that point this point crossing the Equinox here when you returning Crossing these are the four cardinal points so Indians always observed what was a nakshatra at a cardinal point for example veral Equinox has always been New Year in India vernal equinox New Year point so they'll tell you what was a nakshatra at vernal equinox point for example a whole lot of literature says cria nakshatra was at the ver Equinox point that is no longer true today today it's not cria anymore so critica was the world Equinox in 2,400 BCE we know that today because of a planetarian software and things like that we can date these things so anyway what what what I'm saying is that this whole phenomena is because of precision that the calendar shifts when the calendar shifted the gods were unable to perform any yagya or any such thing they've gone to Aditi and said help us Aditi said all sacrifices will begin and end with me meaning ver Equinox will begin and end with me this is what adti was saying so we are now got to see when was The Equinox one Equinox at Aditi and what is Aditi in our nakshatra model in our nakshatra model we have a nakshatra called punarvasu punar vashu has got two stars in it diti and Aditi in the Greek tradition we call it caster and poock right wow caster and poock are diti and Aditi and collectively we call them punarvasu nakshatra if I want to find out when was punarvasu nakshatra at the veral linox point hold your breath I need to crank back in the astronomy software planetarium software to staggering 6,000 BCE that is 8,000 years ago was when our ancestors were thoroughly messed up in the Skies not knowing where when do I do my calendar implying that they had a calendar Thousand Years prior to that that was working because Precision Works in a few thousand years is when it gets messed up so it's got messed up to a point where they reset it to punarvasu or Aditi that is what is telling us what is the 26,000 year uh timeline then so this 26,000 years like I said this is amount of time it takes for the axis of rotation of the earth to trace this path in the sky and come back to we are pointing at a star called Polaris at The Other Extreme is a star called abijit or Vega Vega is a Greek name abijit is the Indian name it'll reach abijit in about 15,000 years from now 14,000 years from now then come back so that's the extent to which axis of rotation takes place and because of that the nakshatras which our ancestors observed they keep changing over time this is why I'm saying Indian astronomy is beautiful because we have got so so many astronomical phenomena in our text which clearly are not relevant today and we can use planetarian software and we can try to find out precisely when was something so here you are a date like 8,000 years ago Indians already had a notion of a calendar already had Notions of uh doing these kind of measurements I find that utterly fascinating let me give you one more amazing thing sure rir this is now the familiar story we all know right the Surya Surya our stories say the purana stories Ric stories that talk about this and say that Surya married sanjina and they had Yama yummy and marital bliss One Fine Day uh Surya got so brilliant so bright sanana could not take the heat so she abandons her husband and she goes off to the cooler region that's very important cooler region and uh before she leaves she leaves a shadow CH in her place One Fine Day Surya discovers a deception hey you're not my wife where's my wife and she says she's gone off to the cooler region so off Surya also goes to the cooler region to search for her he find she's taking the form of a mare a horse and he too takes the form of a horse and in that Union the ashni kumaras are born they the traditional Physicians healer physicians in India associated with horse and other such things they are born so simple enough story over here and like what what on Earth all these kind of uh people say ridiculous story and all this kind of things but for us there are several things to take away from here because there is a passage in Riga that says usas usas is a goddess of dawn okay she's appears at Dawn Goddess of dawn is usas usas awaken the ashis for their share of the Vic sacrifice such a passage is there in the Riga which you don't awaken a grown-up man you're awaken babies so and the point is that at dawn ashin are appearing over there which means along with the sun Ashwin must appear additionally we know because Surya went to the cooler region it should be winter soul in the northern hemisphere because it's gone to southernmost point which means we are looking for a phenomena when Ashwin are appearing at dawn and it is winter solce if you crank this back in time it turns out to be 7,200 BCE staggering amount of time right that is when you find that Ashwin appear with the Sun at winter solce point and they're Rising what was ashwin's astronomy wise astronomy wise there is a beta delin that's a western name so we can identify the stars I might be mistaken it's it's two stars basically it it is two stars twin stars twin stars and they tiny stars not very bright so I don't know why I'm getting goosebumbs but I'm getting but the punch line is not here the punch line is not in the Antiquity of 7,200 BC this was identified by again balag gangadhar tilak he identified it 100 years ago he's been talking about it and abanka also talked about it about 20 30 years ago why is no one talking about it in 2023 I'll tell you I've been talking about this for the last 10 years or so in my talks I've been talking about Ashwin you'll be shocked ranir two years back two papers came out in the Journal called nature in science nature right to two papers came about 2022 or 2021 I think 2022 that blew my mind again the reason is because I got an independent corroboration of what I'm telling you through scientific papers these papers two of them one of them said there was a solar flare that happened about 9,000 years ago precisely 7176 BCE I had dated to 7200 BC their date was 7176 BC see there was a massive solar flare that hit the earth and this solar flare was so big that the graphs in the paper shows completely out of whack let let me give you a backstory over here the normally we always you you know the the the sun has got 11e Sunspot Cycle right when sunspots go to a maximum you find a lot of them I mean you can take a telescope with a uh solar filter and you can see it easily you can see it and I have seen that right now we're going to a maximum again and two years back almost smooth you don't see any solar SP sunspots whenever we have sunspots there's a propensity for the sun to uh have a coronal mass ejection CME event that is when charged particles are thrown out of the sun right and if we are unlucky it comes through to towards the Earth normally we are okay because we got the magnetic lines of force and these are all charged particles so they conducted away to the North Pole South Pole by our magnetic lines and typically what happens is they interact in the upper atmosphere and there's all kind of isotopic activity that takes place radio activity takes place at the North Pole and South Pole that is why we get Aurora Borealis all the Northern Light Southern Lights are because of their activity and typically those radioactive particles rain down on the earth in these polar regions and they're preserved in the ice they preserved in the ice normally it is not a point for contention typically satellites are concerned with there'll be damage radio communication damage no biggy the biggest solar flare we have in recorded history goes back approximately I think 1856 or so it's called the Carrington event if you Google for Carrington event you'll find that this was such a big solar flare at that time that Earth was so ionized not only in the polar region normally see Aurora Borealis about a few latitudes to the north from the North Pole this Northern Light was seen up to Hawaii up to China That's How far these lights had come it was that powerful a storm not only that there were operators in the United States and Portland those days Telegraph lines did do Mor code so they were uh operating the T Telegraph L from Portland to Boston without turning on the power because the lines have become so ionized Telegraph lines are be so ionized the current flowing they're happily doing that Mor code this happened for 2 days over a period of 2 days the Earth was so ionized and this is the biggest event we know and people are saying in Australia people used to read newspapers at night without lights that's amount of light that you had with this event now with this as a backstory let us go back to this earlier event scientists are estimating this 7176 BC to be an order of magnitude bigger than carington event logarithmically 10 times larger and this they have found by drilling the ice course ice course in Antarctica ice course in Greenland they it's like a time capsule right the ice course you can take it to the lab slice uh s slice it little by little and you can study the Isotopes like berum and halflife of these things from the half life you can now estimate how far back in time these guys have drawn graphs in this nature paper off the charts suddenly in 7176 BC all these numbers are off the charts when I saw that I said my God this is exactly what I've been talking Indians remember sua became brilliant for a period of time probably the solar proton event was so great that it ionized the Earth so much anywhere you see you might have seen Brilliance it's like a haze that you see in in places right if you can imagine a bright Haze anywhere you look it might have been like that because sun was brighter B sun was brighter brighter hotter and it happened probably for a period of time maybe a few weeks uh and at a time I got to dial you back to the story who is the son's wife sanana sanj San San was the goddess of or was it just I don't remember she's the goddess but the story says that sanjana was surya's wife and because the son was so brilliant she leaves him and goes away to the cola region and he follows her over there I'm sorry my curiosity is making me want to Google who what sanana was the goddess of San because there there's got to be some metaphor in there as well precisely and sanj's father is vishak karma goddess of clouds and Twilight there you go so she clouds and Twilight went away from the Sun the Twilight left the sun right which means brilliant all the time brilliant no no protection no shade no protection so I I'll give you another uh like Hinduism angle to the story you know the chaa she left behind the shadow she left the son had a baby with that shadow and that baby is called Shani right right right yes yes which is Saturn Saturn Saturn yes makes me think that what was the shadow then or like why what like you know what was relevance Rel the relevance of the Shadow we we'll come back to that but let me finish this episode so after this when I saw this mindblowing story that is a perfect collaboration here I gave you 7,200 by reading the astronomy by looking at the astronomy we call the date to be precisely around 7200 BC plus and minus 80 years this side and that side that's when Ashwin are with heliacal Rising with the Sun at winter solce that is what the story has said that is what the rig the story has said we merely followed the formula and we have got this date and this date has been known to tilak for 100 100 years ago and for the last 10 years I've been uh popularizing this in my talks and so on two years ago this paper comes out and I say wo this is a complete collaboration of what I've been talking about about and another paper to came out the second paper said looking at the tree rings they're apparently able to get the tree ring records and they're saying there was a massive proton event exactly the same time 7176 BC so here you are 9,000 years ago whoever was living in India our ancestors have gone through a massive proton event and remembered that in a story yeah okay I got to pause you a little bit here and give some Millennial perspective reading a lot of and I remember reading about this exact story about and San all this all this stuff um I remember it was a family and even yamraaj is a part of that family I don't yes y Yami are part of the earlier family yes so yeah he's got I think with with sanjana he has kids and then with the yes yes yes Yama yummy with sanjana right Yama is the god of death yes yes and the story is amazing for one more reason Yama lymphs and yummy Shivers it could be a remembrance that when this uh radioactivity happened it's these are all cancer causing berum is massively cancer causing maybe it impacted the youth maybe youth were bedridden and so on and the story remembers yamama is limping not able to walk properly he a god of death in addition and yummy is shivering and this kind of a thing I'm just saying it's posible it's POS um I'll tell you my perspective I remember reading that story being very fascinated by all these amarata stories okay so I'm separating Mahabharat and ramayan from this because I in my heart believe that those events have also happened and those are actual human stories right things have happened in our past right but when it comes to these stories where we're talking about the son being married to the goddess of Twilight this was also written in amarata right and I remember my mom reading out the story to me from the comic book and then I asked her are these people are these aliens are these like some other higher beings and she didn't really have an answer and I remember my question mark just stopping there cut to 2023 and I've got my answer that these are celestial events yes encapsulated in Stories the stories traveled from 7,000 BC yes 9,000 years to pres 2001 when I read that amarata comic book right and this is one story right how many other stories are relaying how much of our past absolutely absolutely that's what I go around saying all the time that our stories are got so much metaphoric content if we have the key to unlock that wisdom we know what that wisdom is how far are we in unlocking these stories according to you like in terms of percentage very poor because we have a tendency today to have a pedestrian understanding only we dismissed this as myth right very negative word myth because we fail to see the metaphoric the philosophical wisdoms in these stories our first tendency is to say they are primitive people we are the most advanced of times and these are primitive people they don't realize that 9,000 years ago their ancestors had the same cranial capacity hey today you use an iPhone but that is no Mark of civilization or progress as such you're a blind user of an iPhone you don't know how it works what's behind it most people at least they don't know what what what is behind it so how does that make you technologically more advanced than that man over there he didn't have an iPhone but he wasn't perfectly in control of his nature and abstract thought and everything else so we should not attribute an early man has been primitive to a point where he was making stories like this these stories have woven intentionally intentionally they were done to encode knowledge if if I were to tell you for example R here's the theorem a theorem B learn this theorem learn that theorem the minute the class is over you're going to forget all about it I mean so dry and you can't take it but the minute I had have an infotainment over there I add a bit of entertainment see our RI understood our minds crave for entertainment even today one minute you're on Twitter one minute you're on Instagram one minute you're on Facebook one minute you're there because you want to be entertained all the time a shot here at this one there that one there and so on Rishi understood that and so they put entertainment over here along with the story metaphor over there so these stories like you correctly said they have passed on to us for 9,000 years and the still alive and they still speak to us all human needs is food shelter clothing and stories and stories entertainment you're a happy man if you have that um really makes me think about all the other celestial events events from ancient history events from prehistory that are actually tailored into Indian culture and even now you are right in saying a big section of the Indian population looks down upon this in urban India not so much in the interior of pedestrian understanding pedestrian understanding of these events so they dismiss it as myth it's a reflection of their ignorance rather than attempt to creatively intellectually decode what their ancestors meant um you know I'll tell you what questions are arising in my head I do kind of again want to talk about the younger D impact theory that we spoke about and then bring you to Vishnu puran about vishnu's first avar which was the matar and you know the other events in that Vishnu puran timeline when you actually study the 10 ofs Etc uh part of me now definitely believes that even if those stories didn't take place on Earth it's a metaphor used to describe celestial events true makes me wonder what that whole churning of The Ocean Story is right right right so yes I have I wondered about this churning of the ocean too but you talk to the dest event the younger dest event so let let's go to to that sure so we got the last glacial maximum approximately 22,000 to 18,000 years ago so you'll have to explain what a glacial maximum is okay okay okay so Earth has gone through ice ages yeah we know that there have been periods of ice ages periods of drought and you might wonder why is it happening well Milan kovich was a Serbian scientist in 1920s who linked this up with the uh uh movements of Earth in other words we know Earth is rotating we know that Earth is going around the sun no biggie we know that also in addition to that Earth is doing three more things one is it's orbit around the Sun is going from elliptical to slightly circular circular to Elliptical circular to elliptical and this is happening in a py period periodicity of about 100,000 years what that effectively means for non-mathematics grads is that Earth is going Clos and far from the Sun you can think of it yes yes but but not significantly but they say that yes yes but the thing is even enough just a little bit it will alter temperatures heavily exactly exactly exactly the second one it is doing is that axial Precision we talked about where the axis of rotation takes 26,000 years to complete that is the second one the third one is Earth's Tilt it goes from 21° to 24 uh Dees and this happens at 41,000 years so we got three additional Cycles now what is Earth's Tilt the the the Tilt we tilted now at 23° right our axis appears to be tilt as we going around the Sun it looks like see this tilt in my arm oh okay taking the North Pole and the South Pole as a reference yes yes it appears if you're tilted just like Uranus appears to be on its floor uh things like that so it appears to be going in his tilt and so on so we you you you have Earth's Tilt going from 21° to 24° and this happens at 41,000 years so three Cycles I talked about 100,000 years circular to Elliptical second one is the PR axial Precision 41 uh 26,000 years third one the Tilt this is around uh 41,000 years Milan kich did not discover these these things were seen by others his contribution is the addition of these three Cycles results in the amount of radiant energy the Earth gets from the Sun okay as in you put these figures into some mathematical formula you'll figure out how much of radiant energy is coming radiant energy means intense intensity of light yes the sunlight how much of sunlight we getting the each the northern Horizon the Northern Hemisphere southern hemisphere how much we getting and sunlight might be measured through the total quantity of photons the flux the amount of flux we're getting solar flux we getting there are other ways to do it but bottom line he said the ice ages and the drought periods of Earth are related to these three Cycles one of the most successful scientific theories to the present day because you go drill in the ice core in Greenland or Antarctica it fits the uh prediction so beautifully so we know that's true so we know through this these cycles that uh 22,000 to 18,000 years ago Earth went through an ice age and this ice age is called the last glacial maximum and this resulted in so much of water locked up in ice that the shorelines are visible far beyond where they are today I'm going to ask you a very rookie question here um have you seen the animated movie Ice Age M mhm you've seen it right love the squirrel yeah so you know exactly what I'm talking uh that's the reference point for two generations when it comes to the ice or I would go as far as saying four five generations know about the ice age from those animated films draw out a picture of the Ice Age for people who've not seen the animated movie uh in terms of what was the earth like then yes I would also go as far as saying what was the equatorial region around the earth like that right right right right right so so there's there is a diversity of opinions among geologists there is an unpopular opinion that Earth was an ice ball the whole earth was a slushy ice ball that that's a very unpopular opinion but there are some people who predict that but then some people estimate using the climate models that the the the ice the glacier the glaciers had come to a fairly large extent in India Himalayas maybe even beyond the Himalayas maybe up to New Delhi and others maybe we had ice ages over here what is a Glacier Glacier Glacier is the ice pack that we have that seems to grow over time if if if you have more of cooler periods it eventually keeps growing over time for example Gango three we have a glacier over there uh correct my science here okay my assumption is that when you totally lower the temperature of the earth which is what is happening in an ice AG gradually what ends up happening is a lot of the water vapor starts collecting and forming ice right that is how Glacier eventually yes yes so effectively Earth was also a lot taller right yeah I guess I could say that ice pack was growing as think there was a layer of ice That Grew around the earth right right right my assumption has always been that in a place as hot as say Tamil Nadu can have been to Tamil Nadu and you need to experience the heat in Tamil Nadu in the summer to really understand how hot India can get uh yes even that part had like I said unpopular opinion some people say even in the equatorial region we had ice that's a minority there's a book there called snowball Earth where the geologist is discussing why he thinks that was the case but then this we are talking about the last glacial maximum that is not as severe as earlier ice ages earlier Ice Ages were even more severe so this was not that severe this this particular I we're talking about and what is the frequency of them like I said the three Cycles right the the the the excentricity cycle Precision Cycle tilt cycle by adding the impact of those three things people can predict when they will come so there is are they at equal no no it's random a because of the cycle it's a it's when the periodicity is resonate right the resonance has got to build up because sometimes you could be out of phase if you're out of phase then the impact is not much but when all three add up with resonance resonances between them that's when you'll have an impact either cold impact or a heat impact one of the two things so over millions of years you're able to predict this phase will be an ice AG in this pH right precisely and there are also warming periods and Cooling precisely all are can be predicted with these kind of cycles and we're currently in a warming period that's what we have found yes we are in the family hockey sck kind of Rise yes we're in a warming period right now and we're making it wayers because of using fossil fuels human activities this there are there are people who are politically tone by this whole thing some people saying it's a natural consequence of Earth Cycles whereas others are saying it has accelerated since the Industrial Revolution because of human activity so we in the holos scene Extinction event right now this is almost a controversial conversation you know like I know how controversial this conversation can get uh I'm all for the environment I strongly believe that our actions are causing a lot of harm to environment it's visible to the human eye if you go out in my balcony Now versus even 2 years ago there's so much more Haze there's so much more smoke of course we are damaging the environment right like as Joe rud said who is the former England cricket team captain he said that when I was playing in it felt like I was eating the air man so there's no way that our actions are not adding to global warming according to me true very true there's a paper that came out from scientist 15,000 scientists in 2017 or 18 they gave a two-page paper with only graphs in each craft the depletion of the forest cover and the dead zones in the sea where there's no life in the sea and the forest cover ozone pack like this they had about 15 to 20 indicators every one of them is down every one of them showing indicators going down and they had promoted that it's urgent we should go to a plant-based diet the sooner we do that the better for the environment obviously reducing fertility also that was a recommendation also when you pinch and poke and punch Mother Nature this much it's going to pinch and poke and punch you back at some point the gear model Earth is alive and she will respond in a way to do that and you feel it you see in the V the concept everything has got Consciousness everything is part of Brahman if everything is part of Brahman there is some amount of Consciousness here here and maybe a growing amount of Consciousness as you go to humans and so on self-awareness and Consciousness so this is part of who we think we are there is consciousness everywhere including the Earth and yes there will be a reaction eventually but we are digressing from the last glacial maximum let's talk about the I say good sir last glacial maximum I I just think you know know these warming be cooling be narratives are important to understand the ice AG better precisely yes yes yes indeed indeed so 18 24,000 22,000 to 18,000 years ago we had this maximum of this last glacial maximum meaning most of the water was locked up in ice and it estimated that the sea levels were 125 M lower than where they are today that's approximately 400 ft can you imagine 125 M lower that's where the water level was that means continents were larger right right and now is a fascinating thing there's a professor called ramaswami SM ramaswami in bhatti dasan University in trishna he published a paper two or three years back saying that he had used remotely operated vehicles and sonar in the Bay of Bengal not just anywhere but he was wanting to find out what is below on the Bay of Bengal 15 km outside the present Shoreline 125 M below he has found man-made structures there uh did they date it yes well well well he's taken many radio samples but I'm telling you from last glacial maximum when could it have been possible that humans were living 125 M below the sea right this is only possible during the last glacial maximum and all over the world sea level was lower by 125 M and he's reporting he's taking pictures can see his paper where there is looks to be a man-made Harbor that is fascinating why would people need Harbor 18,000 years ago who were they trading with what were they trading with what kind of ships were they no iron what were they how were they building these things explain this point further the reverse of this is dwara getting engulfed by the SE I will come to that I will come to that I will come to that so uh Professor ramaswami he's saying he's got a lot of artifacts taken carbon dating I think the results of are not published yet but he thinks that these are going back around 18,000 years he's saying the shape of the harbor seems to be a technology that has moved northwards he's saying daka's shape of the harbor and everything seems to be similar to what he's found here I didn't understand so so he's saying the harbor shape and other such things seem to be similar here and in dwara but dwara now later dated by more than thousand 10,000 years later right I also just want to mention about dka to our listeners we had someone from uh the special forces of the Navy of the Indian Navy it's called the Marcos right whose job was to dive deep and investigate dwarka so this has been found by the Marcos of the Indian military Wonder uh anyway now go on so my my understanding of um well let let me finish bti das's University work so they have found man-made Harbors over there clearly showing to us that human activity was there in the coast regions in India in a very ancient period of time and we have evidence of coastal civilizations not only in this is the puhar not today's puhar but 18,000 years ago that could have been puhar and on dwaraka again we we know from mahabarata that after Arjuna got the yadava women out turns around and Daka sunk under the sea we know that in 2003 there was National Institute of oceanography from Chennai they sent a ship with sonar equipment and things like that to Gulf of cambay because they wanted to lay an internet submarine line so they're mapping the ocean floor in the process of mapping in that paper they have reported that they found a uh 9 kilm wall uh long uh structure that seems to be like a sea wall it's it they said it looks man-made a lot of controversy on that saying a natural or not but it looks like a seaw wall running for 9 km they dredged up a piece of vot carbon dated in Germany Hanover as well as in Hyderabad and they came with a date of around 9,000 years before present for that piece of vot promptly the people saying big deal so what and those kind of things but uh uh there are associations with perhaps dwaraka and I don't fully buy it because my belief is dwaraka is around 150 km out uh from from where they were looking if if you look at B dwara where it is and where uh uh today's dwaraka is my belief is it it's off over there there's some reasons why I think so and I forgotten entirely how to argue that but I wrote it down at some point so it's out in the sea anyway we are finding artifacts we finding artifacts in coastal civilizations here's a fascinating part um R we have stories that talk about uh uh in in in Tamil Nadu in in in Tamil people have got memories of a suum period a suum period that lasted about 10,000 years ago they think there were three s suum periods are literary periods they believe that three suum periods the earliest one was almost 10,000 years ago it happened in a place they called Ten madur Ten mad means Southern madurai okay some some place over there second period was another 3,000 years a literary period Then they believe that the entire thing was submerged and this is written in it is the cultural memory of the Tamil people so many people have memory of this going to the past and talking about this and this entire M mad was submerged and the third literary period took place in the present Maday which is Northern Maday literally so Tamil people pres preserve a memory of lands that have been lost the Tamil nationalists promptly said Kumari kandam that is stretching from Madagascar to Australia to India I don't think that is true because you have to give context to okay okay so in uh uh uh um late 1900s no no no early 1900s when people did not know what plate tectonics plate tectonics are the ones that matter for Continental shaping and those kind of things the Western scientists were interested in knowing why do we have the same fossel in different continents the limur are popular in uh Madagascar but what are the limor doing in India how is that possible so they presumed that it was a land bridge through which these things had come about and the Tamil nationalists promptly said that they must have been uh land connected from Madagascar to Southern India to Australia and that's remembered the suum period land submerged I don't think that is true because I've looked through Google Earth if you can go to Google Earth and look at the depth of the water just outside continental shelf of shelf of India the depth dep Falls of 3 km 2 km 5 km there's no way we had land even during the last glacial maximum last glacial maximum is our reference because water level was 125 M below right so any land is 125 M and above is candidates for the submerged land that tumil memory is there and that does not extend to continent wide but it extends about 90 km from the present Shoreline 90 km from the present Shor line we had land and so tumil memories preserving that there were Coastal civilizations here there that is all sunken during the Earth warming up ice ages going up and rather water levels going up just like how where we are sitting Mumbai probably going be underwater in 200 years easily possible very possible and I I think that's a prediction in fact you don't have to wait that long if the predictions are right it could happen at 2050 in 2050 we could have water levels chenai could be submer mered Kolkata and Bangladesh many places could be submerged uh this side Mumbai also could suffer a lot of submergence events and Florida in the US that could suffer submergence events so people are predicting that I mean given that they said the Doomsday scenario is if the average temperature of the earth goes up by 1.5° compared to Industrial Revolution guess what in 2023 we broke the record many times all over the world we broke this record of 1.5 average uh ctim Centigrade we broke it many times if this is a recurring event into the future I think we're in for some pretty bad weather apocalyptic floods precisely precisely it could could very much happen I mean you know if we truly open eyes apocalyptic natural events are already happening around us right but we're just oblivious or we're just escaping it we we don't make the connections we live in the moment but we don't have memory to connect the events and have a dynamical picture I don't remember so many floods so many storms so many earthquakes happening this frequently when I was a child maybe earthquakes I'll separate from that argument but at least when we're talking about flash floods whatever is happening in the Himalayas this is nature biting back we just need to open our eyes and notice right right right um anyway so you asked me what is my notion of History all this was my deep history early on you asked me what is a deep history and I said it goes back so much of time now I'm talking 18,000 years ago we had people living here and we got cultural memory the south of lands that have been lost the Lost lands would have been around uh the the the late GL one more Ice Age mini ice age called late glacial maximum the last glacial is TW 22 to 18,000 years ago the late glci is around 12,000 years younger D period yes that's a younger D because I believe uh I don't know the exact science behind this but um basically when that meteor hit Earth around 12,000 years ago um it created a massive dust cloud in the air right it's as if you're shooting a bullet into a big ball of sand mhm the dust cloud stayed blocked off sunlight the lack of sunlight cooled down the Earth heavily right for a long time right uh and this is what Randall Carlson's research is also based on he spoke about studying the effect of the glaciers from this period on the geography of North America which is very close to where the impact happened apparently happened in the Gulf of Mexico so he he's done multiple podcasts of Jo Rogan talking about how they've tracked the movement of the glaciers in North America very interesting very interesting when did we last see something like this in the Indian context in the Indian context now brace yourself 74,000 years ago hasn't 74,000 what did we see we had a mount TOA an event a super volcano in Sumatra referred to as Mount TOA Indonesia Indonesia this this was so big and was aimed towards India it put so much of particulate matter in the earth that India and Pakistan were covered by 5 m of Ash can you imagine this 5 m of Ash even today if you go to jalapur jalapur is in Carol District in Andra Pradesh there's a researcher called Ravi kis he's published some works on this he has discovered the ash layer from the 75,000 years ago he's found human artifacts below the ash layer then the ashayer human artifacts above the ashayer showing India was populated before this event and after but 5 m of Ash five M of Ash like my engineering hostel room anyway go on but the point is that it put so much of particulate matter it caused an instant six-year nuclear winter it caused a many thousand what is a nuclear winter nuclear winter yes so this is the concept that we have in um in our apocalyptic view if you have a nuclear explosions and things of that nature there'll be so much of matter in the in the air the dust and other such things floating around the earth and so on prevents the sunlight from coming in cooling down it's a happening over there but this caused a Thousand-Year uh winter over here and they estimate that the breeding adults fell to 10,000 what the number of adults who are alive after the event all over the Earth all over the in in India because all the see in this empty DNA studies they presume that all the non-african people of the world have originated in India through two linages called M and N markers and so what I'm telling you now is related to that after this Mount Toba event happened 74,000 years ago they estimate less than 10,000 adults were there on Earth on on on this region from whom we have all come if this theory is right you and I are alive because one of our ancestors are there yeah who survived that event it's not just you and me but it's also Cristiano Ronaldo everybody way roone everybody uh Lebron not LeBron James because technically he's of African desent according to this according to this theory yes all the non-african populations have come from these these people okay so amazing Theory but but we are seeing this what you said is about the scrandle theory about uh we seeing this again and again katua katua was a massive volcano that happened Sumatra uh 1800s I'm not mistaken 1880 or something like that that also put so much of particulate matter in the skies and we have had problems 600 current ERA one more massive volcano happened and I'm trying to link that up with u uh what happened in India we had droughts over here and can we see that regimes have changed the chalukyas came at that time there were other powers that faded away Powers there for Thousand Years suddenly fading away and a new power coming over there without a war or any such thing the only thing is that there must have been so much of unrest and problems with no crops growing because of nuclear kind of winter kind of do you think there's anything mentioned about this 75,000 year old um ice age that we spoke about the Sumatra explosion so so if there is we have not yet found it we not decoded it there's so much in our Vic literature including the vas themselves there so much over there that these are all metaphoric content nobody can take the vas and do a word for word translation and hope to get meaning out of it not going to happen there's a lot to be decoded in the vas precisely precis it's got to be interpreted and the question is what is it what is it encoding what is it information encoded over there we have no idea some of it so but I believe an event of this magnitude would have been remembered through uh time and maybe somewhere an echo of it would be there okay so we've almost reached the end of this conversation sir good good um you know what I will definitely say is that I adore talking to archaeologists as well but for different reasons as I said at the start of the episode often I feel like professions and professional guidelines make you think within a certain boundary which is important for that craft right uh because archaeologists the job that they do is they go into the field with an open mindset they'll search for evidence first and foremost so the methodology is important what kind of methodology they follow they got to follow the prescriptions in that field right so the conversations I end up having with them are very different sometimes it's about the texture of the things that they find Weg the the only issue with that is that it limits room for conversations about thought experiments so many of the conversations we've had today I won't say are exactly thought experiments but it's a more expansive thought right based on Ancient scripture perhaps my last question on this entire show for you would be another thought experiment M related to the younger D impact Theory okay now that was supposedly a very important cataclysmic event in the history absolutely of the earth yes I remember Joe Rogan and Randle Carlson both saying that even that reduced the human population heavily it was almost like a reboot of civilization so let's Place ourselves in a situation where a meteor is about to hit the Earth right now we have cameras we have mics we have electricity we have the internet right people take the internet for granted the internet is a series of vires under the Earth absolutely yes even that's going to get wrecked because of meteor hitting the O right our technology is going to get wrecked lots of people that we know around us are going to die right the human population will be reduced mhm it'll be apocalyptic there will be a nuclear winter mhm it'll be exactly like those apocalyptic movies that you see right and when you have kids say you survive M you'll have to learn survival skills in the same way that Bear Grills does on his show Etc true you'll begin from a bit a little bit of a hunter gatherer mindset that's what your life will become if there's truly an apocalyptic event right right now we know for a fact that the apocalyptic event happened in 10,000 BC roughly around the time frame yeah uh the effects of it were there for a while after that we had to restart civilization that is my theory against the archaeologists that claim that because the indust valley civilization was not that Advanced okay that's what the theory is that the kind of art that we see the kind of architecture that we see um they weren't capable of the televisions that we hear about in the Mahabharat the aeroplanes that we hear about in the ramayan right right that's the theory that we have proof about the IND civilization my angle on this is that even if technology advanced a lot before 10,000 BC it was all crushed to nothing because of the younger Dr impact and then we to restart from there and what we see in the indust valley civilization is 8,000 years roughly post the younger D impact uh so we had to rebuild that's why yes you know I know the indust civilization had that whole drainage system it had governance and all that and there's still so much we don't understand about it right but it was a reboot of Indian civilization we are taught that it was the beginning of the Indian civilization right uh do you have anything to say about absolutely so many thoughts some are speculative some we have uh evidence or we have uh informed opinions on some things for example remember I told you the Carrington event 1856 or so such a big solar flare is known to have hit the earth they say if that magnitude flare hit the Earth today life would stop existing the way you understand it for at least 2 years it says every telephone line every sorry every Power Line would be gone Transformers would have exploded and so you have no electricity anywhere in the world and all your satellites will be gone all your communication will be gone all your beautiful internet streaming Netflix everything gone and you wouldn't have this it'll take the Earth 2 years to recover that's the amount of time it'll take to ramp up the factories again get the Transformers again repair power all over the world so you can imagine that kind of Apocalypse is not only because of meteor the sun can easily do it to you easily do it we can't predict that right we can't we can't predict that this happened we know this big event happened in 1800s it could happen anytime anytime it could have a huge solar flare and modern technological Life as we understand it today would would have gone with that is that in mind I often tell people think about this Western Europe was a backward Primitive Place for a long time after they adopted Christianity in Constantine Christianity 330 current ER they checked out all the Greek knowledge Greek philosophy which was all India looking right vant looking they chucked them out as pagans and they became a theocracy a church theocracy where they had Orthodoxy over there feudal kind of government you're not allowed to think right you had to be a a sheep follow the shepherd kind of a thing they had this going till 1500 1500 they have if you see my talks you'll understand how they're ramped up on Knowledge from India and all this kind of things and they were primed for the so-called Renaissance right they primed for that and the so-called age of rationalism and things like that when they started learning things from Indian knowledge I often tell people as a thought experiment these guys who didn't even have place value uh addition subtraction multiplication they learned only, 1550 from India from the time of newon in 1600 still today they managed to go from nothing to sending a spaceship to Jupiter to Mars and other such places so 600 years that is all it took from zero to understanding burnell's principle of lift to building W Brothers aircraft to building these huge rockets that can have enough impulse to take you out out of space and things like that 600 years I ask the question often how many 600 years Cycles do we have in the past where maybe not pervasively like we know today but maybe in some aspect of Technology where you went to Great Heights and lost it all of course rational thinking person will ask where are the artifacts I want to find a fossil I want to find a remain and intriguingly time to time we find these things one of them is the antia the antia was a mechanism found in early 1900s of the seas in Greece Mediterranean Sea they found it intricate hearing mechanism we know that because we can x-ray this and find out intricate mechanism that seems to be some kind of a Celestial clock it shouldn't belong to that period that kind of mechanism and that kind of computation should not belong to that period of time but it is there so like this time to time we find something says wo what is this for example the so-called austia battery where uh uh uh descriptions are given on how we can make a electrolyte and have some kind of insulator and there's a potential difference and you can make a current out of that doesn't belong to a period if we believe in linear growth of science but it is there so I often ask a question how many 600 period Cycles do we have going back 10,000 years 20,000 years yeah very POS so I I'm open to this I have not closed my mind to this I think one of the things I would like to teach my own children about history is about the impact of nature on History this is one thing I've learned as a very macro lesson on the show we've had an archaeologist Dr prakar who's actually explored the pyramids as well even inside the pyramids they found a battery and spoken about it I I've heard about this yes so and this is a qualified archaeologist uh speaking you know my point is that even the ancient Egyptians didn't believe that they were the ancient Egyptians they felt they were the modern Egyptians and the ancient Egyptian culture was from almost a LH years ago this is the kind of History I'd want to tell my children about not just the history that we read in our history textbooks and with that sir that's the episode for today it's wonderful it's been excellent discussion and ranir thank you for inviting me it's been a pleasure talking all these subjects pleasure speaking to you sir I want the Indian narrative on this I hate calling it alternative history because it's not it's not deep history deep history that's the word deep history it's not prehistory it's not Proto history it is deep history we're talking about uh history that's studied with more of an open mind right uh of course there's room for error Even in our conversations we're doing many thought experiments in our conversations but this is the exact kind of conversation that leads to archaeological findings you have to be suggestive at least while you're talking about it's what could have been it's like I say if you break these chains of 1500 BC in Invasion and throw them away the shackles are out of your mind then this is what I meant so many many things are there in the Indian context we can reconcile them without any problem to the ancient past like for example we talked about science 8,000 BC 9,000 BC well we got carbon dating from sarasti synu civilization birana the oldest dates are 9,000 years before present happy reconciliation of uh astronomy and radiocarbon dating but anyway it's been a pleasure talking all these things with you R Raj vam sir love how much of a deep history n you are just like myself it's just two nerdy engineering Brads abely breaking down some deep history nerds nerds that's who we are yeah that's the key to life and happiness and love sometimes I don't know why I said that thank you for being on the show sir appreciate you appreciate your time thank you that was the episode for today and this is exactly the kind of conversation I crave both in life and on TRS we're always looking for guest recommendations from you guys I know how much you'll enjoy these historical and cultural conversations tell me what you thought about this conversation as well and please do send in some epic guest recommendations DRS will be back soon two episodes are releasing every week and the knowledge download ladies and gentlemen has only just begun we'll see you very very [Music] soon [Music] oh
